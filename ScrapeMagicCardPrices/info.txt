Assignment #8
Due: 11:59pm April 14

Support your answer: include all relevant discussion, assumptions,
examples, etc.(10 points)

(Spam classification using Naive Bayes classifier)
1. Create two datasets; the first called Testing, the second called Training. 
	
	The Training dataset should:
		a. consist of 10 text documents for email messages you consider spam (from your spam folder)
		b. consist of 10 text documents for email messages you consider not spam (from your inbox)

	The Testing dataset should:
		a. consist of 10 text documents for email messages you consider spam (from your spam folder)
		b. consist of 10 text documents for email messages you consider not spam (from your inbox)

	Upload your datasets on github
	Please do not include emails that contain sensitive information

2. Using the PCI book modified docclass.py code and test.py (see Slack assignment-8 channel)
Use your Training dataset to train the Naive Bayes classifier ( e.g., docclass.spamTrain() )
Use your Testing dataset to test (test.py) the Naive Bayes classifier and report the classification results.

3. Draw a confusion matrix for your classification results
(see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix)

4. Report the precision and accuracy scores of your classification results
(see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall)
