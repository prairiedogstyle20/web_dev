That’s why a little hyperbole never hurts. People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole. It’s an innocent form of exaggeration—and a very effective promotion.”</p><p>Ever since <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump">Trump</a> entered the Presidential race, in 2015, he’s been selling a fantastical vision of a wall across the southern border. Now reality has finally caught up with him, and he isn’t enjoying the experience. “I’m not happy about it,” he <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/429603-trump-cant-say-im-happy-with-border-security-deal" target="_blank">said</a> to reporters on Tuesday morning, after they asked him to comment on the funding agreement that Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill had reached the previous evening.</p><p>It’s clear why Trump isn’t happy. This time last year, he was demanding <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-whitehouse/trump-seeks-25-billion-for-border-wall-offers-illegalalien-citizenship-idUSKBN1FD2UU" target="_blank">twenty-five billion dollars</a> for a vast concrete wall. At the end of December, he shut down large parts of the federal government in support of his demand for $5.7 billion in funding and two hundred miles of steel barriers. Under the <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/us/politics/shutdown-deal.html" target="_blank">deal</a> reached on Monday, Congress would provide $1.375 billion for fifty-five miles of slat fencing. In Wall Street terms, the agreement would give Trump about twenty-four cents on the dollar. As of Wednesday morning, he hadn’t yet agreed to the plan but it looked like he would. The Washington <em class="">Post</em> and CNN both reported that Trump intended to sign the spending bill.</p><p>He certainly knows how coercive deals work. When he was in the private sector, he was often on the other end of them. In 2006, Andrew Tesoro, a New York architect who designed the clubhouse at Trump National Golf Club Westchester, informed Trump’s representatives that he was owed a hundred and forty thousand dollars. They offered him fifty thousand, take it or leave it. Fearing he might get nothing, Tesoro submitted a revised bill for that amount. Then Trump called him up and said that he’d pay half of it. “I walked away with $25,000,” Tesoro <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestreptalks/2016/07/13/this-architect-says-trump-almost-destroyed-his-business-but-that-doesnt-mean-they-cant-get-coffee/#26c26a0945de" target="_blank">told</a> Forbes, in 2016.</p><p>In all of his businesses, Trump was known for behaving like this toward smaller venders and contractors. How did he get away with it? He had the leverage. To get paid in full, people like Tesoro would have had to take him to court, an expensive, risky, and hassle-inducing prospect. So, they tended to settle for dimes on the dollar, as Trump knew they would.</p><p>Now Trump’s the one lacking leverage. Having already folded when the shutdown damaged his poll ratings, his threat to cause another government closure isn’t credible. He’s also been threatening to declare a <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/12/politics/trump-national-emergency-gop/index.html" target="_blank">national emergency</a> and seize some extra funds from the Pentagon budget, but Republican leaders on the Hill don’t like this scheme, which, in any case, would quickly get snagged in the courts.</p><p>Trump is stuck, so he’s resorting to yet more B.S. After registering his unhappiness about the spending deal to reporters, he went on, “It’s not doing the trick, but I’m adding things to it. And when you add the things I have to add, it’s all gonna happen where we’ll build a beautiful, big, strong wall that’s not gonna let criminals and traffickers and drug dealers and drugs into our country.” Later in the day, in a pair of <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1095469447933059073" target="_blank">tweets</a>, Trump said, “Looking over all aspects knowing that this will be hooked up with lots of money from other sources . . . Will be getting almost $23 <em class="small">BILLION</em> for border security. Regardless of Wall money, it is being built as we speak.”</p><p>Virtually nobody who has followed the story in any detail is falling for this spin. “One point three billion dollars? That’s not even a wall, a barrier,” <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/listening-to-sean-hannity">Sean Hannity</a>, who is arguably Trump’s biggest booster in the media, <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sean-hannity-slams-garbage-compromise-on-preliminary-agreement-on-border-security" target="_blank">said</a> to his Fox News Channel audience on Monday night. “Any Republican that supports this garbage compromise, you will have to explain.” Mark Meadows, the head of the House Freedom Caucus, <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/freedom-caucus-chair-mark-meadows-gives-border-wall-deal-a-resounding-no" target="_blank">told</a> Hannity’s colleague Neil Cavuto, “Only in Washington, D.C., can we start out with needing twenty-five billion dollars for border-security measures and expect applause at $1.37 [billion]. I mean, only in D.C. is that a winning deal.”</p><p>For once, Meadows was right. But, by Tuesday evening, there were signs that even some of the most rabid supporters of the wall had realized that further resistance was futile. Or, perhaps, they had been issued a new set of talking points.

Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) walked up to a lectern in the White House Rose Garden to make an announcement of monumental importance that clearly couldn’t wait a moment longer. “Before we begin,” he said, “I’d like to just say that we have a large team of very talented people in China. We’ve had a negotiation going on for about two days. It’s going extremely well.” Then Trump brought up North Korea, Syria, and the state of the U.S. economy. Finally, he moved on to the business of the moment: a desperate effort to put the best possible face on the humiliating defeat that he suffered on Capitol Hill over funding for his border wall. “We are going to be signing today, and registering, a national emergency,” he said. “And it’s a great thing to do because we have an invasion of drugs, an invasion of gangs, an invasion of people, and it’s unacceptable.”\n\nHe didn’t leave it at that; he doesn’t know the concept. Instead, he sought to justify his action by trotting out some of his old lies about undocumented immigrants, and some he’s added to his repertoire more recently. “We have far more people trying to get into the country today than probably we’ve ever had before.” (The number of interdictions at the southern border is running at roughly half the level it was a decade ago.) The crime and drug problem in El Paso is “a hundred per cent” better since the construction of a border barrier. (El Paso has long had one of the lowest crime rates of any city in the country.) Federal prisons are full of illegal immigrants. (Even setting aside people being held for immigration offenses, undocumented immigrants make up a tiny proportion of the federal-prison population.)\n\nTrump’s description of the situation at the border is almost entirely fictitious, of course, but in one sense it is real. It’s a central element of the political narrative he has constructed for his white-nationalist base over the past three and a half years, and, as he helpfully sought to explain, it’s one he can’t easily back away from at this stage. “I ran on a very simple slogan: ‘Make America Great Again,’&nbsp;” he said. “If you’re going to have drugs pouring across the border, if you’re going to have human traffickers pouring across the border in areas where we have no protection, in areas where we don’t have a barrier, then it’s very hard to make America great again.”\n\nIn this carefully concocted narrative, the wall isn’t a mere stretch of concrete or steel fencing stretching along the border; it’s a symbol of national sovereignty and regeneration. But, if it’s so important, why didn’t Trump get it built during his first two years in office, when the Republicans controlled both houses of Congress? Trump’s failure to get his own party to support what was arguably his signature campaign pledge demonstrates that he is fundamentally a weak and isolated President. But, of course, he can’t admit that publicly, either. Instead, he said, “It would have been great to have done it earlier. But I was a little new to the job, a little new to the profession. And we had a little disappointment for the first year and a half. People that should have stepped up did not step up. But we’re stepping up now.” Take that, Paul Ryan!\n\nThis official unveiling of the former House Speaker as Trump’s 2020 whipping boy didn’t come as a surprise. Neither did the declaration of a national emergency. Trump has been threatening to make this move for months, and Mitch McConnell, the Majority Leader in the Senate, had announced his intentions from the Senate floor on Thursday afternoon. Earlier on Thursday, according to a tick-tock by the Washington *Post*, Trump was still threatening to veto the bipartisan spending deal that allotted $1.375 billion to border barriers. In order to get him to sign the bill and keep the government open, McConnell agreed to support the declaration of an emergency and encouraged other Republicans to support it. \n\nHere was yet another example of how the G.O.P. leadership’s Faustian pact with Trump has driven them to enable his more authoritarian tendencies. During his Rose Garden address, Trump freely conceded that his emergency decree will immediately be challenged in the lower courts, and quite likely get snagged there. But citing what happened to his travel ban, he said he was hopeful of prevailing in the Supreme Court—an outcome that can’t be ruled out given its conservative tilt.\n\nIf this happens, Trump will have succeeded in undermining the principle that the President proposes and the Congress disposes, which is contained in Article I of the Constitution. And, as Democrats and Republicans were quick to point out, he will have set a precedent. In a statement issued on Friday afternoon, Thom Tillis, a Republican senator from North Carolina, invoked the prospect of “President Elizabeth Warren declaring a national emergency to shut down banks and take over the nation’s financial institutions.”\n\nTrump doesn’t care about precedent, of course. After he had finished his peroration, CNN’s Jim Acosta, who is possibly his least favorite reporter, asked him to explain the disconnect between his description of what’s happening at the border and data from his own government that shows border crossings “at a near record low” and “undocumented immigrants committing crimes at lower levels than native Americans.” Trump dodged the question and called CNN “fake news.” The next questioner, *Playboy’s* Brian Karem, followed up Acosta’s question and asked Trump to say where he gets his figures. “I get my numbers from a lot of sources, like Homeland Security, primarily,” Trump replied. “And the numbers that I have from Homeland Security are a disaster.”\n\nAnother of the reporters asked to what degree outside conservative voices had influenced Trump’s thinking on the national emergency.  Rather than dismissing the question as impertinent, he said, “Look, Sean Hannity has been a terrific supporter of what I do.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Rush Limbaugh, I think he’s a great guy. Here’s a guy who could speak for three hours without a phone call. Try doing that sometime.” Turning to Ann Coulter, who has excoriated the President on Twitter this week for agreeing to a budget deal that won’t fund the wall, Trump recalled that in 2016 she had predicted he would win the election. “So I like her,” he said. “But she’s off the reservation.”\n\nArguably, the most revealing exchange came when Peter Alexander, of NBC News, asked Trump to admit that the spending deal he was to sign later in the day gave him less money for his wall than he could have got before the government shutdown. Of course, Trump never admits anything. He insisted that he’d got “billions and billions of dollars for other things—port of entries, lots of different things” from Congress. But, when it came to the wall, he went on, “they skimped.” Then he added, “So I did—I was successful in that sense, but I want to do it faster. I could do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn’t need to do this, but I’d rather do it much faster.”\n\nIt will be interesting to see what the courts make of Trump’s admission that, when it came time to declare a national emergency, he didn’t “need to do this.” At the least, it was good to get it on the record from his own lips. Inside the Reagan Administration there used to be a saying: “Let Reagan be Reagan.” In the Trump Administration such a statement would be entirely redundant. The President lets it all hang out: the incoherence, the fabrications, the mendacity, the raging but delicate ego, the attention-deficit disorder, and, occasionally, the revealing shards of self-illumination. He just can’t help himself.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald

Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) want to declare a national emergency on Friday? That was what he intended to do during his statement in the White House Rose Garden. But when he came out before the cameras, he started off talking not about an emergency but about China. Then he spoke about the U.K. “We have a lot of great announcements having to do with Syria,” he said, before discussing his upcoming summit with Kim Jong Un, of North Korea.\n\nA few minutes in, he appeared to get to the subject at hand. “Today I’m announcing several critical actions that my Administration is taking to confront a problem that we have right here at home,” he said, reading from his notes. “We’re going to confront the national-security crisis on our southern border. And we’re going to do it one way or the other.” But then he turned back to other matters. He spoke of rebuilding the military, of the stock market’s performance. “Our country is doing very well economically,” he said. Eventually he returned to the border. “They say walls don’t work—walls work a hundred per cent,” he said. He repeated his lies and distorted talking points about how drugs get into the U.S. and about what human trafficking looks like. He attacked his enemies, the Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. “It’s all a big lie; it’s a big con game,” he said. Finally, the announcement came. “I’m going to be signing a national emergency,” he said, glancing down again at his notes, adding, a little later, “And it’s a great thing to do, because we have an invasion of drugs, an invasion of gangs, an invasion of people.”\n\nWho wanted him to declare a national emergency? Democrats didn’t—they’re already moving to block the order. Many Republicans didn’t want him to do it, either. “I don’t think much of that idea,” Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, [told](https://twitter.com/chashomans/status/1096162933367865344) a reporter last month. On Friday, Ann Coulter [dismissed](https://twitter.com/AnnCoulter/status/1096317175277576192) a national-emergency declaration as a “scam.” So why did he do it? When a reporter pressed him on whether he would concede that he didn’t get the deal he wanted from Congress, Trump, of course, refused to concede. And, in doing so, he undercut what little concrete rationale his emergency had to begin with. “I could do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn’t need to do this. But I’d rather do it much faster,” he said. “And I don’t have to do it for the election. I’ve already done a lot of wall for the election. 2020. And the only reason we’re up here talking about this is because of the election—because they want to try to win an election, which it looks like they’re not going to be able to do.” So there it is, as straight as you can get it from this President: he didn’t need to do this, and it’s not about the election, but the only reason he’s talking about it is because of the election.\n\nIt’s a good day to remember that, according to Joshua Green’s “[Devil’s Bargain](https://www.amazon.com/Devils-Bargain-Bannon-Nationalist-Uprising/dp/0735225044),” Trump’s aides came up with the idea of the wall in 2014, not for policy reasons but for memory reasons. “Inside Trump’s circle, the power of illegal immigration to manipulate popular sentiment was readily apparent, and his advisers brainstormed methods for keeping their attention-addled boss on message,” Green wrote. “They needed a trick, a mnemonic device. In the summer of 2014, they found one that clicked.” Not with the public, or even with the Republican Party—but with Trump himself.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c767e716b454591ad9c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration"},{"id":"5c2e1c7a41c92e2c9b85da19","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Border Wall","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"border-wall"}],"sections":[{"id":"59f0d2a0d2beb9720f019591","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Current","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"current"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a69d2e2e17730741c68c","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Eric Lach writes and edits [The Current](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current), *The New Yorker’s* online news and current-events column.

The person who recruited her promised that, if she worked for a few years, she could leave with enough money to help her family build a new house and start a better life in Indonesia. Her salary would be only a hundred and fifty dollars a month, but job opportunities in Indonesia were scant, so she accepted, and her recruiter arranged a tourist visa. When she arrived in L.A., though, her employer confiscated her passport. Matul lived in a corner of the family room in her employer’s home, cooking and cleaning for up to eighteen hours a day, without pay; if her work didn’t meet certain standards, her employer beat her. Her tourist visa soon expired. Because she spoke very little English and didn’t know anything about the U.S. immigration system, she had no idea where she would go if she did manage to leave the house. Her employer told her that, if she went to the police, she would be arrested. But, after three years, Matul had learned enough English to write a letter asking for help, and she gave the letter to a neighbor’s nanny.\n\nMatul imagined that, after escaping, she would work illegally until she could afford a plane ticket back to Indonesia. She couldn’t fathom a way to stay in the United States. The neighbor, though, took her to *CAST*{:.small}, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit that helps survivors of trafficking. Workers there told her that she could apply for a T visa, which is designed for victims like her. It took Matul a moment to understand what they meant. “I didn’t even know I had been trafficked,” she told me. Matul got the visa, then a green card, and, eventually, U.S. citizenship. She now works for *CAST*{:.small}, as the coördinator of its Survivor Leadership Program, which gives survivors of trafficking a platform to help and advocate for others who are escaping similar situations. In 2015, she also helped form the U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking, a board composed of eleven survivors, which helps the President shape anti-trafficking legislation. In 2016, she spoke at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nIt is difficult to determine the prevalence of trafficking in the U.S. because there is no single reliable source for statistics; experts rely on hotlines, court cases, and, in the case of non-citizen victims, visa applications to collect data. Since 2000, when the T-visa program began, thousands of people have applied, and the number of yearly applicants has steadily increased as victims and advocates have become more aware of the program. (The same is true for U visas, which are designed for victims of general crimes and are now so frequently requested that they have a [fifty-month](https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/) waiting period.) The T visa has proved to be a reliable safety net for survivors of trafficking, and no viable alternative exists for those who are rejected or don’t apply.\n\nTrump has tried to establish himself as a crusader against trafficking. The issue is bipartisan, appealing equally to left-leaning labor reformers and evangelical Christians. In October, 2018, Trump was the first President to address an interagency task-force meeting on trafficking. “Our country will not rest until we have put these vile organizations out of business and rescued every last victim,” he said in his speech. In an op-ed published last November, in the Washington *Post*, Ivanka Trump touted the President’s appearance at the task-force meeting as one of his many accomplishments. In January (which is National Slavery and Human-Trafficking Prevention Month), Trump held a roundtable discussion, in Texas, in which he made reference to human trafficking, claiming that building a border wall would “stop it cold.” Later in the month, as he defended the government shutdown, Trump relied on one of his preferred images of trafficking: women being smuggled across the southern border, “tied up, with duct tape on their faces, put in the backs of vans.” \n\nThis is a false characterization of the problem. According to data from the Department of Justice, in 2017, roughly two-thirds of the trafficking victims who were served by organizations that received funding from the Office for Victims of Crime were U.S. citizens. Among non-citizens, illegal border-crossing is not typically the issue. “Most of the victims we work with come in on perfectly good visas,” Martina Vandenberg, the founder and president of the Human Trafficking Legal Center, told me. This mischaracterization is part of a cynical strategy that uses trafficking to bolster arguments for harsh immigration policies and also makes it more difficult for non-citizen victims to remain safely in the U.S. Last year, despite having originally exempted people who were applying for humanitarian visas, the Administration announced that, beginning in mid-November, applicants who are denied T visas may be required to appear in immigration court, the first step in deportation proceedings. Because the change was presented as a separate, almost dully bureaucratic shift in the rules, officials have an easy defense: the T-visa program itself has not changed, Michael Bars, a spokesman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, stressed in e-mails. But this is one of a few ostensibly minor changes the Trump Administration has made to the system that have already had an outsized impact on the trafficking community.\n\nIn the past two months, I have spoken to lawyers, advocates, and victims—and I’ve heard the testimonies of non-citizen victims through their lawyers and advocates when they were too scared to speak themselves—who report a chilling effect. Since the rule changed, in November, Vandenberg hasn’t filed an application for a single T visa. “At this point, you have to ask yourself whether it is ethical to apply for a visa when you’re putting your client in danger of deportation,” she said. Dilcia Molina, who works at a Washington, D.C.,-based nonprofit called La Clínica del Pueblo, told me that she recently counselled a Salvadoran woman who had been impregnated by her trafficker and was desperate for an abortion. “She says, ‘Please don’t ask me to apply for a T visa. I saw on TV that the President hates people looking for visas or asylum,’ ” Molina recalled. As a result, victims who once freed themselves from  trafficking with the support of the U.S. government are now being forced to choose between staying with their traffickers or escaping to a life of working illegally and avoiding immigration authorities. “For eighteen years”—since Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act—“we have built a system that is the envy of the world for treating trafficking survivors humanely,” Vandenberg said. “The Trump Administration has managed to tear it down in two years.”\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nWhen Trump was elected, advocates were reasonably confident that anti-trafficking legislation was strong enough and had enough support in Congress and government agencies to endure even the most capricious Presidency. Though protections like the Trafficking Victims Protection Act remain intact (Trump reauthorized the law last month), the Administration’s influence has been more insidious. Since the beginning of Trump’s term, even before the change in November, advocates for victims of trafficking had begun to notice changes in the process. Applicants for T visas who entered the country illegally are sometimes required to pay a nine-hundred-and-thirty-dollar filing fee to request that the government excuse their illegal entry. Under past Administrations, the fee was regularly waived if the victims were unable to pay. “Over the summer, these fee waivers were being rejected across the board,” Lori Cohen, the director of an anti-trafficking initiative at Sanctuary for Families, told me. “Trafficking victims were being asked to provide tax receipts to prove income. Guess what, brothels don’t provide tax receipts to trafficking victims. Johns don’t give receipts for services received.”\n\nThe Administration is also threatening to make life more dangerous for non-citizen trafficking victims in subtler ways. In September of last year, the President proposed “public charge” legislation that would penalize both immigrants who have received government assistance and emigrants applying for entrance to the U.S. who seem likely to need assistance in the future. The law would spare humanitarian-visa applicants entirely, and it would also spare some humanitarian-visa holders applying to adjust their immigration status, but it wouldn’t do so automatically; visa-holders would have to apply for a waiver, which would be adjudicated by U.S.C.I.S. “They have debt, medical issues, mental-health issues, lost employment, no credit history, and now they are being told, ‘If you access public benefits, you may end up being deported,’ ” Jean Bruggeman, the executive director of the anti-trafficking coalition Freedom Network USA, said. “But if they don’t access them, they are likely to go back into the underground economy, where, once again, they will be trafficked. It’s like telling survivors of domestic violence, ‘Here are these lovely shelters; if you come and stay in one, we will deport you.’ ”\n\nSince Trump’s announcement in November, advocates have noticed that, after receiving applications for T visas, immigration authorities have begun asking that the victims and their lawyers provide further proof that the applicants were trafficked. “We would very rarely get requests for more evidence,” Katherine Soltis, an attorney at an immigrant-services nonprofit in Washington, D.C., called Ayuda, said. “Now it’s nearly every case.” Authorities are even more likely to scrutinize cases when clients committed crimes during their time in captivity. “There has been a dramatic shift in T-visa applicants getting requests for further evidence based on arrest history,” Sabrina Talukder, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society in New York, told me. A year ago, she met a client who had been trafficked after she ran away from an abusive home life. “Her story is very common among L.G.B.T.Q. youth,” Talukder said. “It’s made more complicated because she is undocumented. People won’t hire her, and so she’s vulnerable and at risk of being trafficked again in order to survive.” Talukder explained to the client that, because she had been arrested for petty crimes connected to her trafficking, she would almost certainly receive a request for more evidence, which would lead to  scrutiny of her record and the strong possibility that her application would be denied and she would be deported. Decisions are discretionary, leaving lawyers and victims uncertain about why they were denied and what that denial means for future applications. Considering the risk, the client decided not to apply for a T visa. “Congress has stated, in reauthorizing the T.V.P.A., that L.G.B.T.Q. youth are at particular risk,” Talukder told me. “This is designed for her in so many ways. It’s horrifying.” \n\nLast year, the Department of Justice announced that certain grants that were provided by the Office for Victims of Crime, and that organizations used to help people clear their criminal records, can no longer be used for that purpose. The O.V.C. still funds anti-trafficking projects, but for many victims who emerged from trafficking having committed crimes that were directly part of their trafficking, like prostitution, or that were tangential to it, like loitering or theft, that legal service was crucial to their recovery. Criminal records keep victims from coming forward, or, if they do come forward, prevent them from getting jobs, affordable housing, and, crucially, visas and green cards. The O.V.C. grants allowed lawyers to do the difficult, intricate work of applying, often in a variety of jurisdictions, to vacate records. This change, another ostensibly minor one, is sure to make the lives of citizen and non-citizen victims of trafficking harder and more dangerous. “It’s very punitive and targeted,” Jessica Emerson, a lawyer who works with the Survivor Reëntry Project, a group that helps trafficking victims vacate their records, said. “The thinking is that criminals are criminals. And we don’t do anything to help criminals.” When I spoke to Emerson, she and her colleague Kate Mogulescu were at a conference, training other lawyers on the process for filing records to be vacated; both their work and the conference itself relied on O.V.C. funding.\n\nScaling back these services isn’t just cruel; it’s shortsighted. Programs that help victims of trafficking—in particular, T visas—are indispensable tools for the U.S. government in its efforts to stop trafficking. The majority of successful trafficking prosecutions involve victims who provide evidence and testimony with the hope—almost a guarantee under previous Administrations—that they will receive protection and services to help them. Through the application process for T visas, victims are encouraged, but not obliged, to aid in the investigation of their traffickers, which leads to more prosecutions and better statistics. “Our clients come forward and provide extremely detailed information about how the rings operated, where they lived, where they frequented—detailed information that then helped Homeland Security develop a robust case that the Justice Department could prosecute,” Cohen said. Now she thinks twice before recommending her clients as witnesses. “Before, if they told us they would be deported or targeted if they came forward, we could tell them, ‘That’s not true,’ ” Cohen said. “Now we can’t.”\n\nTrump often cites prosecutions that have occurred under his Administration as evidence of his fight against trafficking. In the lead-up to Trump’s trip to the border, the Department of Justice (breaking its shutdown-caused silence) tweeted two press releases about the prosecution and sentencing of men involved in the Rendon-Reyes ring, a trafficking group of mostly Mexican nationals that was first broken up in 2013, during the Obama Administration. Talukder, from Legal Aid, represents one of the victims of the Rendon-Reyes ring. After the victim came forward, in 2014, her story followed a once-typical narrative: she testified against her traffickers, which made it impossible for her to go back to Mexico and live among their friends and family, and then received a T visa, which allowed her to stay in the U.S. Since the rule change in November, Talukder has applied for half of the T visas that she normally would have.\n\nTrafficking thrives in the shadows, so, for now, the impact of these changes might be only perceptible to the victims and the advocates who work with those victims. It will take many months before the chill around T visas is reflected in U.S.C.I.S. statistics, and, without any definitive data available on the extent of trafficking in the U.S., it will remain difficult to gauge its long-term effects. That’s one of the reasons that Trump is able to present himself as a champion of survivors despite experts raging against him and his policies. This week, the White House announced that one of Trump’s guests at his State of the Union address, on Tuesday, will be a human-trafficking investigator from the Department of Homeland Security. Advocates are worried about how the President will frame the issue. “All of us working on human trafficking, we are tired of being the Trump Administration’s fig leaf,” Vandenberg said.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nOn Wednesday, survivors across the country began fielding requests from the Blue Campaign, the D.H.S.’s human-trafficking outreach and prevention project. The D.H.S. was looking for a survivor to attend a press conference on trafficking with the President on Friday, and they were very clear about who they wanted. “They asked for a survivor who had crossed the southern border,” Nat Paul, a survivor of human trafficking and a human-rights advocate, told me. (A spokesperson for the D.H.S. declined to comment.)\n\nUntil recently, Paul was part of the U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking under Trump; she had been recruited by the State Department to represent the L.G.B.T.Q. community. In November, though, she resigned, citing, among other things, the Administration’s habit of using her “dead name” (the name she was given at birth) and her rising concern that non-citizen victims had become targets for deportation. She was quick to praise the remaining members (and the State Department officials who had recommended her), but she had felt ignored in D.C.; one conservative senator, she told me, dismissed the Council as “only victims.” Matul had also tried to remain hopeful when Trump was elected, but she did not remain on the Council. “I don’t know if I could work with an Administration that doesn’t have the same values I have,” she told me. Evelyn Chumbow, an inaugural member who is originally from Cameroon, also resigned, citing her worry that the Administration doesn’t care about the disproportionate effect that trafficking has on people of color. “Americans would be ashamed to know that there are Africans and African-Americans still being sold into slavery,” she said. \n\nSome survivors of trafficking work closely with government projects like the Blue Campaign; they have to constantly negotiate their advocacy work with those government programs with their concerns about the President’s rhetoric. As news of the proposed meeting spread through the survivor community, it set off alarms. “Our concern was that the White House would use the trafficking issue to get funding for the wall,” Matul said. Paul was similarly worried. “We wanted to find a strong and experienced advocate who would not play into the myth of a duct-taped woman thrown into a trunk,” she told me. Survivors passed along a name: Suamhirs Piraino-Guzman, a Honduran-American man who had previously served on the Council. He ticked some of the Administration’s boxes: he was from Central America; he had been sexually exploited; and he had crossed the southern border. In other, important ways, he defied Trump’s portrayal of trafficking. Piraino-Guzman wasn’t bound and hidden in the back of a car. When he was fourteen, traffickers brought him through an official port of entry with forged documents; he was drugged and put on display so that U.S. border authorities would think that he was sick and let him through. That trick worked for the next six months, during which Piraino-Guzman was transported legally, with documents, through airports around the country. He was drugged, sold, and raped an estimated two hundred times. \n\nEven if advocates wanted to give Trump his perfect survivor, they would have had a difficult time finding one. The image conveyed by Trump is not a complete fiction, but it comes close. “I have talked to others at Freedom Network who have provided services for hundreds of survivors in the U.S., and none of us know someone who fits that profile,” Bruggeman told me. “We know people who came in on legal visas. We know people who paid smugglers and then crossed the border and then were sold to traffickers. People come across the border in various ways, but no one has any familiarity with anyone who came in bound and gagged.” And among non-citizens, labor trafficking is as much a concern as sex trafficking. “We have huge cases, ten or fifteen or twenty people coming here on temporary work visas,” Matul told me. “They are coming here to work, and they end up being trafficked.” \n\nWhen Paraino-Guzman was approached about the request, he told me, “My first thought was no way in hell. These people are trying to use a survivor story to make a pro-wall argument.” Then he thought it over; he is supportive of the Blue Campaign’s goals, and he thought that something productive might come out of a meeting. “If I don’t go and provide the correct and experience-based narrative, they are going to find someone whose message can be manipulated,” he said. Paraino-Guzman told the D.H.S. that he was interested, but he set some guidelines. He would have to speak—“If they just want a photo op, I won’t be there,” he said—and he wanted more information before he agreed to go. “I asked questions,” he said. “What are you planning to do? Why do you have so many specific requests about the survivor?” \n\nWhile waiting for the D.H.S.’s decision, Piraino-Guzman read a Fox News op-ed by Timothy Ballard, a former D.H.S. agent who went on to found the anti-trafficking group Operation Underground Railroad. Ballard’s group has long drawn criticism for its tactics, which involve elaborate stings. When Piraino-Guzman read Ballard’s op-ed, titled “I’ve Fought Sex Trafficking as a D.H.S. Special Agent. We Need to Build the Wall for the Children,” he said, “My blood boiled. This organization says they are protectors of kids, and here you are pushing a narrative that puts kids in danger.” He made his opinion known on Twitter: “What a disgusting display,” he wrote. “As a sex trafficking survivor that was brought to this country, a wall won’t stop traffickers. I was brought in through an actual POE and the traffickers used false documents. stop trying to make a wall argument based on horrible, racist information.” Five minutes later, a D.H.S. representative sent an e-mail saying, politely, that Piraino-Guzman wouldn’t be needed on Friday. “It was weird,” he said. \n\nSurvivor-less, Trump doubled down on his narrative about trafficking and the wall. He held his press conference, and, afterward, the White House released a fact sheet that uses actual numbers to present a mostly imaginary vision of trafficking across the border. It notes that, during a migrant’s journey, he or she is at grave risk of sexual assault and violence, which readers might mistakenly conflate with sex trafficking. It cites a decrease in illegal border crossings in parts of the country that include a physical barrier, making no attempt to show how many, among those who crossed the borders, were victims of trafficking. The only data point on the fact sheet that specifically describes trafficking is the number of arrests made by *ICE*{:.small} and Homeland Security: fifteen hundred and eighty-eight in 2018. The sheet does not elaborate on those arrests, other than to point out that, among them, only forty-five were for labor trafficking. These figures mean little without context. They reflect arrests in the U.S., but not specifically of people who crossed the border illegally. And the fact that the vast majority of arrests were for sex trafficking does not mean that labor trafficking is less prevalent; it just means that it’s less of a priority for law-enforcement officials. Nearly all federal criminal prosecutions of traffickers are for sex trafficking, while nearly all civil cases are for labor trafficking. Those victims exist; they just can’t get the Trump Administration to see them.  \n\nMatul often thinks about what her life would be like if she had been sold into slavery in America in 2017 rather than in 1997. Would she have been brave enough to write that letter asking for help? Would she, after listening to a *CAST*{:.small} lawyer­ outline the new risks of applying for a T visa, have done so anyway? Would she have been on the Council? Would any such Council exist? “At *CAST*{:.small}, they told me that, under U.S. law, no one could not pay me for the work that I do, or abuse me, even though I was illegal,” she said. “I can’t imagine how I would feel today—to be scared of my trafficker and scared of being deported.”\n\n*This article was supported by the [Fuller Project for International

Guggenheim Museum is crowded after five on a Saturday, when the price of admission is “pay what you wish.” Even in below-freezing weather this weekend, the ticket line snaked around the corner. People came in groups, couples, and alone. As happens in large crowds, at times the noise level rose spontaneously, as though something or someone were demanding attention, but immediately subsided. At any given time, there were people milling around in the lobby, looking at the door as though waiting for someone and up at the galleries as though planning something. Some of them were.\n\nA bit after six, a group went up to one of the galleries. They were people of different ages, from their late teens to their sixties. They could have been New Yorkers or visitors; some of them looked like they might be artists, and some looked like they were probably students. They were all of those things. If one looked closely, similar groups of between a half-dozen and a dozen people were coalescing on all levels of the museum.\n\nA few minutes after six-thirty, the photographer Nan Goldin appeared in the lobby. There was a flurry of hugs and hellos, and several people snapped photos. It could have been a celebrity sighting—Goldin, whose [work](https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/nan-goldin) is in the museum’s collection, is a Guggenheim type of celebrity. She stood in the middle of the lobby, visible from almost any point of the great round building. Then the noise level rose and did not subside.\n\nSmall flyers started falling, as though from the glass dome, swirling like snow as they descended the six stories. Within minutes the floor was coated in white. The sheets of paper were prescriptions, made out by a “Robert Sackler, MD,” to a Solomon R. Guggenheim, for eighty-milligram pills of OxyContin, to be taken twenty-four times a day. Each script contained a quotation: “If OxyContin is uncontrolled, it is highly likely that it will eventually be abused.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How substantially would it improve our sales?”\n\n\n+++feature-small\n+++group-2\n[#image: /photos/5c60525def30412e80e7e2b5]||||||\n[#image: /photos/5c604ef64eb6353e6d6700ee]||||||\n+++\n+++\n\nThe quotation came almost verbatim from a [filing](https://arstechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mass_AGO_Pre-Hearing_Memo_and_Exhibits-1.pdf) made last month in the Massachusetts Superior Court by that state’s attorney general. The complaint alleges that this was an exchange between the inventor of OxyContin, Robert Kaiko, who was concerned about promoting the opioid-based pain medication, and Richard Sackler, [whose family owns the OxyContin manufacturer](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-family-that-built-an-empire-of-pain), Purdue Pharma, and who, at the time, was a senior vice-president with the company. The Massachusetts lawsuit is only the latest against the company, which back in 2007 first [pleaded guilty](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/10/business/11drug-web.html?module=ArrowsNav&contentCollection=Business%20Day&action=keypress&region=FixedLeft&pgtype=article) to misleading regulators, doctors, and patients about the addictive qualities of OxyContin. The Guggenheim protest was the latest in a series staged by Goldin and her group [*PAIN*{:.small}](https://www.sacklerpain.org/mission-statement) (Prescription Addiction Intervention Now), which has staged actions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian, and Harvard University’s art museums, which, like the Guggenheim, accept donations from the Sackler family. The Guggenheim’s education center bears the Sackler name, as does the Metropolitan’s [wing](http://www.sackler.org/arts/sacklerwing/) that houses the ancient Roman Temple of Dendur.\n\nOn the floor of the Guggenheim lobby appeared empty orange medicine bottles with authentic-looking labels: “Prescribed to you by the Sackler Family. OxyContin. Extremely addictive. *WILL KILL*{:.small}.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Rx# 400,000 dead.” A yellow strip up the side of the label read, “Side effect: Death.” At the same time, red banners were draped over the side of the ramp on four different levels. They read, “*400,000 DEAD*{: .small},” “*SHAME ON SACKLER*{: .small},” “*200 DEAD EACH DAY*{: .small},” and “*TAKE DOWN THEIR NAME.*{:.small}” On the lobby floor, about ten people lay down to stage a die-in, amid the flyers and pill bottles.\n\n\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5c604f2e339ba179a40b7748]||||||\n+++\n\n\nHundreds of visitors filled the galleries, creating a theatre in the round. Security guards did not intervene. Goldin spoke in staccato sentences, and a small group of supporters standing near her repeated each one of them in unison, insuring that the sounds carried up.\n\n“We want their money,” Goldin said.\n\n“For safe-consumption sites.”\n\n“For harm reduction.” \n\n“For treatment.”\n\n“It’s time, Guggenheim! Take down their names!”\n\nThe crowd, in which it was now impossible to distinguish protesters from people who came to the museum to see art on the walls, picked up the chant, and then another: “Oxy money is in the halls! Throw them out if you have the balls!”\n\nGoldin’s personal history with OxyContin, which she has described in talks and an [essay](https://www.artforum.com/print/201801/nan-goldin-73181), appears typical: she was prescribed the drug for a surgery several years ago, and, she has said, “got addicted overnight.” She went from getting the drug legally to buying it on the black market to, finally, overdosing on fentanyl, a super-strong synthetic opioid. Soon after, when she finally got clean, she started *PAIN*{: .small}, which is modelled in part on the *AIDS*{: .small} activist group *ACT UP*{: .small}. \n\n“Meet us at the Met!” Goldin said, and her group of supporters shouted it to the galleries.\n\nAbout a hundred people, led by protesters carrying the banners that had been draped from the galleries, marched six blocks down Fifth Avenue to the Metropolitan Museum. Seven police S.U.V.s followed them, and police tried to direct the marchers to move to the sidewalk, but the protesters stayed in the roadway, chanting, “Sacklers lie, people die!” and “Shame on the Sacklers!” \n\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5c60528aad6b912caebc7be1]||||||\n+++\n\n\nFor ten years after the drug’s introduction, in 1996, Purdue Pharma aggressively promoted OxyContin, falsely claiming that it posed little or no risk of addiction and encouraging its prescription for chronic pain—after surgeries when opioid pain relief was not warranted, and in quantities that far exceeded patients’ needs. The company provided financial incentives for doctors to encourage these practices. *PAIN*{: .small} activists argue that the fines paid by the company, such as the six-hundred-million-dollar penalty in the 2007 New York case and several million [donated](https://www.purduepharma.com/ongoing-efforts-to-help-address-the-opioid-crisis/strong-track-record/) to efforts to combat the opioid epidemic, are insignificant compared to the tens of billions of dollars that Purdue has made off OxyContin. \n\nProtesters stood on the steps of the Met holding their banners, and Goldin spoke from the sidewalk, facing the stairs. “We have to bring down the Sackler family,” she said. “They should be in jail, next to El Chapo!”\n\n“In the ground, next to Pablo Escobar!” another speaker, the harm-reduction activist Robert Suarez, proposed.\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5c604f414eb6353e6d6700f0]||||||\n+++\n\n\nA third speaker, a woman named Alexis Pleus, who said that she came down to New York City from upstate with “a group of grieving families,” said, “I don’t care if they go to jail. I want their money. And buprenorphine,” an opioid derivative that is considered far less addictive than OxyContin, which makes it the drug of choice for treating opioid addiction. Buprenorphine, however, is much more difficult to obtain than OxyContin, at least in part because Food and Drug Administration guidelines for prescribing it are much [more stringent](https://www.naabt.org/faq_answers.cfm?ID=29) than for OxyContin.\n\nPleus told her own story. Her son Jeff was prescribed OxyContin following a knee surgery. He was a high-school wrestler, and his doctor told him to take the drug for pain management, so that he could continue wrestling. “They caused me to become an accomplice in my son’s death,” Pleus said. “When he talked of his pain, I said, ‘Did you take your pills?’&nbsp;” Jeff became addicted and eventually died of an overdose. Now, Pleus said, she wants the Sacklers to fund overdose-reversal medication and training, harm-reduction programs, and addiction treatment.\n\n“I don’t expect you to care about my son,” she said. “But I want you to care about the four hundred thousand people who have died!”\n\n“I don’t expect you to care about Jeff,” she continued.\n\n“We care!” the protesters on the steps responded, interrupting her.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"functional-tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bc86f2c9a24498e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bc86f2c9a24498e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"_sensitivecontent","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sensitivecontent"},{"id":"5afc81c3f2298131d017bb5b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Functional

The space, which opened in 1978 and is known as the Sackler Wing, is also itself a monument, to one of America’s great philanthropic dynasties. The Brooklyn-born brothers Arthur, Mortimer, and Raymond Sackler, all physicians, donated lavishly during their lifetimes to an astounding range of institutions, many of which today bear the family name: the Sackler Gallery, in Washington; the Sackler Museum, at Harvard; the Sackler Center for Arts Education, at the Guggenheim; the Sackler Wing at the Louvre; and Sackler institutes and facilities at Columbia, Oxford, and a dozen other universities. The Sacklers have endowed professorships and underwritten medical research. The art scholar Thomas Lawton once likened the eldest brother, Arthur, to “a modern Medici.” Before Arthur’s death, in 1987, he advised his children, “Leave the world a better place than when you entered it.”\n\nMortimer died in 2010, and Raymond died earlier this year. The brothers bequeathed to their heirs a laudable tradition of benevolence, and an immense fortune with which to indulge it. Arthur’s daughter Elizabeth is on the board of the Brooklyn Museum, where she endowed the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art. Raymond’s sons, Richard and Jonathan, established a professorship at Yale Cancer Center. “My father raised Jon and me to believe that philanthropy is an important part of how we should fill our lives,” Richard has said. Marissa Sackler, the thirty-six-year-old daughter of Mortimer and his third wife, Theresa Rowling, founded Beespace, a nonprofit “incubator” that supports organizations like the Malala Fund. Sackler recently told _W_ that she finds the word “philanthropy” old-fashioned. She considers herself a “social entrepreneur.”\n\nWhen the Met was originally built, in 1880, one of its trustees, the lawyer Joseph Choate, gave a speech to Gilded Age industrialists who had gathered to celebrate its dedication, and, in a bid for their support, offered the sly observation that what philanthropy really buys is immortality: “Think of it, ye millionaires of many markets, what glory may yet be yours, if you only listen to our advice, to convert pork into porcelain, grain and produce into priceless pottery, the rude ores of commerce into sculptured marble.” Through such transubstantiation, many fortunes have passed into enduring civic institutions. Over time, the origins of a clan’s largesse are largely forgotten, and we recall only the philanthropic legacy, prompted by the name on the building. According to _Forbes_, the Sacklers are now [one of America’s richest families](https://www.forbes.com/families/list/), with a collective net worth of thirteen billion dollars—more than the Rockefellers or the Mellons. The bulk of the Sacklers’ fortune has been accumulated only in recent decades, yet the source of their wealth is to most people as obscure as that of the robber barons. While the Sacklers are interviewed regularly on the subject of their generosity, they almost never speak publicly about the family business, Purdue Pharma—a privately held company, based in Stamford, Connecticut, that developed the prescription painkiller OxyContin. Upon its release, in 1995, OxyContin was hailed as a medical breakthrough, a long-lasting narcotic that could help patients suffering from moderate to severe pain. The drug became a blockbuster, and has reportedly generated some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue for Purdue.\n\nBut OxyContin is a controversial drug. Its sole active ingredient is oxycodone, a chemical cousin of heroin which is up to twice as powerful as morphine. In the past, doctors had been reluctant to prescribe strong opioids—as synthetic drugs derived from opium are known—except for acute cancer pain and end-of-life palliative care, because of a long-standing, and well-founded, fear about the addictive properties of these drugs. “Few drugs are as dangerous as the opioids,” David Kessler, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, told me.\n\nPurdue launched OxyContin with a marketing campaign that attempted to counter this attitude and change the prescribing habits of doctors. The company funded research and paid doctors to make the case that concerns about opioid addiction were overblown, and that OxyContin could safely treat an ever-wider range of maladies. Sales representatives marketed OxyContin as a product “to start with and to stay with.” Millions of patients found the drug to be a vital salve for excruciating pain. But many others grew so hooked on it that, between doses, they experienced debilitating withdrawal.\n\nSince 1999, two hundred thousand Americans have died from overdoses related to OxyContin and other prescription opioids. Many addicts, finding prescription painkillers too expensive or too difficult to obtain, have turned to heroin. According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, four out of five people who try heroin today started with prescription painkillers. The most recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that a hundred and forty-five Americans now die every day from opioid overdoses.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/59ea5c722c0f8a390a0aff3c]||||||\n+++\n\nAndrew Kolodny, the co-director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative, at Brandeis University, has worked with hundreds of patients addicted to opioids. He told me that, though many fatal overdoses have resulted from opioids other than OxyContin, the crisis was initially precipitated by a shift in the culture of prescribing—a shift carefully engineered by Purdue. “If you look at the prescribing trends for all the different opioids, it’s in 1996 that prescribing really takes off,” Kolodny said. “It’s not a coincidence. That was the year Purdue launched a multifaceted campaign that misinformed the medical community about the risks.” When I asked Kolodny how much of the blame Purdue bears for the current public-health crisis, he responded, “The lion’s share.”\n\nAlthough the Sackler name can be found on dozens of buildings, Purdue’s Web site scarcely mentions the family, and a list of the company’s board of directors fails to include eight family members, from three generations, who serve in that capacity. “I don’t know how many rooms in different parts of the world I’ve given talks in that were named after the Sacklers,” Allen Frances, the former chair of psychiatry at Duke University School of Medicine, told me. “Their name has been pushed forward as the epitome of good works and of the fruits of the capitalist system. But, when it comes down to it, they’ve earned this fortune at the expense of millions of people who are addicted. It’s shocking how they have gotten away with it.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\n“Dr. Sackler considered himself and was considered to be the patriarch of the Sackler family,” a lawyer representing Arthur Sackler’s children once observed. Arthur was a gap-toothed, commanding polymath who trained under the Dutch psychoanalyst Johan H. W. van Ophuijsen, whom Sackler proudly described as “Freud’s favorite disciple.” Arthur and his brothers, the children of Jewish immigrants from Galicia and Poland, grew up in Brooklyn during the Depression. All three attended medical school, and worked together at the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center, in Queens, collectively publishing some hundred and fifty scholarly papers. Arthur became fascinated, he later explained, by the ways that “nature and disease can reveal their secrets.” The Sacklers were especially interested in the biological aspects of psychiatric disorders, and in pharmaceutical alternatives to mid-century methods such as electroshock therapy and psychoanalysis.\n\nBut the brothers made their fortunes in commerce, rather than from medical practice. They shared an entrepreneurial bent. As a teen-ager, Mortimer became the advertising manager of his high-school newspaper, and after persuading Chesterfield to place a cigarette ad he got a five-dollar commission—a lot of money at a time when, he later said, “even doctors were selling apples in the streets.” In 1942, Arthur helped pay his medical-school tuition by taking a copywriting job at William Douglas McAdams, a small ad agency that specialized in the medical field. He proved so adept at this work that he eventually bought the agency—and revolutionized the industry. Until then, pharmaceutical companies had not availed themselves of Madison Avenue pizzazz and trickery. As both a doctor and an adman, Arthur displayed a Don Draper-style intuition for the alchemy of marketing. He recognized that selling new drugs requires a seduction of not just the patient but the doctor who writes the prescription.\n\nSackler saw doctors as unimpeachable stewards of public health. “I would rather place myself and my family at the judgment and mercy of a fellow-physician than that of the state,” he liked to say. So in selling new drugs he devised campaigns that appealed directly to clinicians, placing splashy ads in medical journals and distributing literature to doctors’ offices. Seeing that physicians were most heavily influenced by their own peers, he enlisted prominent ones to endorse his products, and cited scientific studies (which were often underwritten by the pharmaceutical companies themselves). John Kallir, who worked under Sackler for ten years at McAdams, recalled, “Sackler’s ads had a very serious, clinical look—a physician talking to a physician. But it was advertising.” In 1997, Arthur was posthumously inducted into the Medical Advertising Hall of Fame, and a citation praised his achievement in “bringing the full power of advertising and promotion to pharmaceutical marketing.” Allen Frances put it differently: “Most of the questionable practices that propelled the pharmaceutical industry into the scourge it is today can be attributed to Arthur Sackler.”\n\nAdvertising has always entailed some degree of persuasive license, and Arthur’s techniques were sometimes blatantly deceptive. In the nineteen-fifties, he produced an ad for a new Pfizer antibiotic, Sigmamycin: an array of doctors’ business cards, alongside the words “More and more physicians find Sigmamycin the antibiotic therapy of choice.” It was the medical equivalent of putting Mickey Mantle on a box of Wheaties. In 1959, an investigative reporter for _The Saturday Review_ tried to contact some of the doctors whose names were on the cards. They did not exist.\n\nDuring the sixties, Arthur got rich marketing the tranquillizers Librium and Valium. One Librium ad depicted a young woman carrying an armload of books, and suggested that even the quotidian anxiety a college freshman feels upon leaving home might be best handled with tranquillizers. Such students “may be afflicted by a sense of lost identity,” the copy read, adding that university life presented “a whole new world . . . of anxiety.” The ad ran in a medical journal. Sackler promoted Valium for such a wide range of uses that, in 1965, a physician writing in the journal _Psychosomatics_ asked, “When do we _not_ use this drug?” One campaign encouraged doctors to prescribe Valium to people with no psychiatric symptoms whatsoever: “For this kind of patient—with no demonstrable pathology—consider the usefulness of Valium.” Roche, the maker of Valium, had conducted no studies of its addictive potential. Win Gerson, who worked with Sackler at the agency, told the journalist Sam Quinones years later that the Valium campaign was a great success, in part because the drug was so effective. “It kind of made junkies of people, but that drug worked,” Gerson said. By 1973, American doctors were writing more than a hundred million tranquillizer prescriptions a year, and countless patients became hooked. The Senate held hearings on what Edward Kennedy called “a nightmare of dependence and addiction.”\n\nWhile running his advertising company, Arthur Sackler became a publisher, starting a biweekly newspaper, the _Medical Tribune_, which eventually reached six hundred thousand physicians. He scoffed at suggestions that there was a conflict of interest between his roles as the head of a pharmaceutical-advertising company and the publisher of a periodical for doctors. But in 1959 it emerged that a company he owned, MD Publications, had paid the chief of the antibiotics division of the F.D.A., Henry Welch, nearly three hundred thousand dollars in exchange for Welch’s help in promoting certain drugs. Sometimes, when Welch was giving a speech, he inserted a drug’s advertising slogan into his remarks. (After the payments were discovered, he resigned.) When I asked John Kallir about the Welch scandal, he chuckled, and said, “He got co-opted by Artie.”\n\nIn 1952, the Sackler brothers bought a small patent-medicine company, Purdue Frederick, which was based in Greenwich Village and made such unglamorous staples as laxatives and earwax remover. According to court documents, each brother would control a third of the company, but Arthur, who was occupied with his publishing and advertising ventures, would play a passive role. The journalist Barry Meier, in his 2003 book, “[Pain Killer: A ‘Wonder’ Drug’s Trail of Addiction and Death,](https://www.amazon.com/Pain-Killer-Wonder-Drugs-Addiction/dp/1579546382/)” remarks that Arthur treated his brothers “not as siblings but more like his progeny and understudies.” Now Raymond and Mortimer, who became joint C.E.O.s, had a company of their own.\n\nIn the early sixties, Estes Kefauver, a Tennessee senator, chaired a subcommittee that looked into the pharmaceutical industry, which was growing rapidly. Kefauver, who had previously investigated the Mafia, was especially intrigued by the Sackler brothers. A memo prepared by Kefauver’s staff noted, “The Sackler empire is a completely integrated operation in that it can devise a new drug in its drug development enterprise, have the drug clinically tested and secure favorable reports on the drug from the various hospitals with which they have connections, conceive the advertising approach and prepare the actual advertising copy with which to promote the drug, have the clinical articles as well as advertising copy published in their own medical journals, [and] prepare and plant articles in newspapers and magazines.” In January, 1962, Arthur travelled to Washington to testify before Kefauver’s subcommittee. A panel of senators assailed him with pointed questions, but he was a formidable interlocutor—slippery, aloof, and impeccably prepared—and no senator landed a blow. At one point, Sackler caught Kefauver in an error and said, “If you personally had taken the training that a physician requires to get a degree, you would never have made that mistake.” Quizzed about his promotion of a cholesterol drug that had many side effects, including hair loss, Sackler deadpanned, “I would prefer to have thin hair to thick coronaries.”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/59ea5c7257e38e49cd3157bc]||||||\n+++\n\nAs the Sacklers grew wealthy, they became patrons of the arts. In 1974, the brothers gave the Met three and a half million dollars, enabling the construction of the wing housing the Temple of Dendur. Mortimer used the space for a lavish birthday party. The cake was in the shape of the Great Sphinx, but its face had been replaced with Mortimer’s.\n\nIn April, 1987, when Arthur Sackler was seventy-three, he demanded that his third wife, Gillian, account for all their household expenditures. He dictated a terse memo: “I am determined to take command of all situations for which I personally and my estate bear the ultimate obligation.” A month later, he had a heart attack, and died. The family gathered for a fond memorial service at the Met, but Arthur’s children fought bitterly with Gillian, and sparred with Mortimer and Raymond, over the estate. They accused Gillian of trying to steal their inheritance, and of being “inspired variously by greed, malice, or vindictiveness toward her stepchildren.” According to the minutes of a family meeting, Arthur’s daughter Elizabeth suggested that he had hidden the true worth of some family investments, “because he didn’t want Morty and Ray to think they were more valuable.” A family lawyer told the children, “There were no absolutely white lilies here on either side.”\n\nArthur’s descendants still owned a third of Purdue Frederick, and Mortimer and Raymond were interested in buying the stake. The company, which had moved to Connecticut and would eventually change its name to Purdue Pharma, had made a great deal of money under their stewardship. But such riches were about to seem paltry. By the time the brothers made their bid, Purdue was already developing a new drug: OxyContin.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nHumans have cultivated the opium poppy for five thousand years. The father of medicine, Hippocrates, recognized the therapeutic properties of the plant. But even in the ancient world people understood that the benevolent powers of this narcotic were offset by the perils of addiction. In his 1996 book, “[Opium: A History](https://www.amazon.com/Opium-History-Martin-Booth/dp/0312206674),” Martin Booth notes that, for the Romans, the poppy was a symbol of both sleep and death. During the nineteen-eighties, Raymond and Mortimer Sackler had a great success at Purdue with an innovative painkiller called MS Contin, a morphine pill with a patented “controlled release” formula: the drug dissolved gradually into the bloodstream over several hours. (“Contin” was short for “continuous.”) MS Contin became the biggest seller in Purdue’s history. But, by the late eighties, its patent was about to expire, and Purdue executives started looking for a drug to replace it.\n\nOne executive who was centrally involved in this effort was Raymond’s son Richard, an enigmatic, slightly awkward man who, in the family tradition, had trained as a doctor. Richard had joined Purdue in 1971 as an assistant to his father, and worked his way up. His name appears on numerous medical patents. In the summer of 1990, a Purdue scientist sent a memo to Richard and several other colleagues, pointing out that MS Contin could “face such serious generic competition that other controlled-release opioids must be considered.” The memo described ongoing efforts to create a product containing oxycodone, an opioid that had been developed by German scientists in 1916.\n\nOxycodone, which was inexpensive to produce, was already used in other drugs, such as Percodan (in which it is blended with aspirin) and Percocet (in which it is blended with Tylenol). Purdue developed a pill of pure oxycodone, with a time-release formula similar to that of MS Contin. The company decided to produce doses as low as ten milligrams, but also jumbo pills—eighty milligrams and a hundred and sixty milligrams—whose potency far exceeded that of any prescription opioid on the market. As Barry Meier writes, in “Pain Killer,” “In terms of narcotic firepower, OxyContin was a nuclear weapon.”\n\nBefore releasing OxyContin, Purdue conducted focus groups with doctors and learned that the “biggest negative” that might prevent widespread use of the drug was ingrained concern regarding the “abuse potential” of opioids. But, fortuitously, while the company was developing OxyContin, some physicians began arguing that American medicine should reëxamine this bias. Highly regarded doctors, like Russell Portenoy, then a pain specialist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, in New York, spoke out about the problem of untreated chronic pain—and the wisdom of using opioids to treat it. “There is a growing literature showing that these drugs can be used for a long time, with few side effects,” Portenoy [told the _Times_](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/28/us/patients-in-pain-find-relief-not-addiction-in-narcotics.html?pagewanted=all), in 1993\\. Describing opioids as a “gift from nature,” he said that they needed to be destigmatized. Portenoy, who received funding from Purdue, decried the reticence among clinicians to administer such narcotics for chronic pain, claiming that it was indicative of “opiophobia,” and suggesting that concerns about addiction and abuse amounted to a “medical myth.” In 1997, the American Academy of Pain Medicine and the American Pain Society published a statement regarding the use of opioids to treat chronic pain. The statement was written by a committee chaired by Dr. J. David Haddox, a paid speaker for Purdue.\n\nRichard Sackler worked tirelessly to make OxyContin a blockbuster, telling colleagues how devoted he was to the drug’s success. The F.D.A. approved OxyContin in 1995, for use in treating moderate to severe pain. Purdue had conducted no clinical studies on how addictive or prone to abuse the drug might be. But the F.D.A., in an unusual step, approved a package insert for OxyContin which announced that the drug was _safer_ than rival painkillers, because the patented delayed-absorption mechanism “is believed to reduce the abuse liability.” David Kessler, who ran the F.D.A. at the time, told me that he was “not involved in the approval.” The F.D.A. examiner who oversaw the process, Dr. Curtis Wright, left the agency shortly afterward. Within two years, he had taken a job at Purdue.\n\nMortimer, Raymond, and Richard Sackler launched OxyContin with one of the biggest pharmaceutical marketing campaigns in history, deploying many persuasive techniques pioneered by Arthur. Steven May, who joined Purdue as an OxyContin sales representative in 1999, recalled, “At the time, we felt like we were doing a righteous thing.” He used to tell himself, “There’s millions of people in pain, and we have the solution.” (May is no longer working for Purdue.) The company assembled a sales force of as many as a thousand representatives and armed them with charts showing OxyContin’s benefits. May attended a three-week training session at Purdue’s headquarters. At a celebratory dinner following the training, he was seated at a table with Richard Sackler. “I was blown away,” he recalled. “My first impression of him was ‘This is the dude that made it happen. He has a company that his family owns. I want to _be_ him one day.’ ”\n\nA major thrust of the sales campaign was that OxyContin should be prescribed not merely for the kind of severe short-term pain associated with surgery or cancer but also for less acute, longer-lasting pain: arthritis, back pain, sports injuries, fibromyalgia. The number of conditions that OxyContin could treat seemed almost unlimited. According to internal documents, Purdue officials discovered that many doctors wrongly assumed that oxycodone was _less_ potent than morphine—a misconception that the company exploited.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/59ea5c72ca1b673b45f0e61c]||||||\n+++\n\nA 1995 memo sent to the launch team emphasized that the company did “not want to niche” OxyContin just for cancer pain. A primary objective in Purdue’s 2002 budget plan was to “broaden” the use of OxyContin for pain management. As May put it, “What Purdue did really well was target physicians, like general practitioners, who were not pain specialists.” In its internal literature, Purdue similarly spoke of reaching patients who were “opioid naïve.” Because OxyContin was so powerful and potentially addictive, David Kessler told me, from a public-health standpoint “the goal should have been to sell the least dose of the drug to the smallest number of patients.” But this approach was at odds with the competitive imperatives of a pharmaceutical company, he continued. So Purdue set out to do exactly the opposite.\n\nSales reps, May told me, received training in “overcoming objections” from clinicians. If a doctor inquired about addiction, May had a talking point ready. “ ‘The delivery system is believed to reduce the abuse liability of the drug,’ ” he recited to me, with a rueful laugh. “Those were the specific words. I can still remember, all these years later.” He went on, “I found out pretty fast that it wasn’t true.” In 2002, a sales manager from the company, William Gergely, told a state investigator in Florida that Purdue executives “told us to say things like it is ‘virtually’ non-addicting.”\n\nMay didn’t ask doctors simply to take his word on OxyContin; he presented them with studies and literature provided by other physicians. Purdue had a speakers’ bureau, and it paid several thousand clinicians to attend medical conferences and deliver presentations about the merits of the drug. Doctors were offered all-expenses-paid trips to pain-management seminars in places like Boca Raton. Such spending was worth the investment: internal Purdue records indicate that doctors who attended these seminars in 1996 wrote OxyContin prescriptions more than twice as often as those who didn’t. The company advertised in medical journals, sponsored Web sites about chronic pain, and distributed a dizzying variety of OxyContin swag: fishing hats, plush toys, luggage tags. Purdue also produced promotional videos featuring satisfied patients—like a construction worker who talked about how OxyContin had eased his chronic back pain, allowing him to return to work. The videos, which also included testimonials from pain specialists, were sent to tens of thousands of doctors. The marketing of OxyContin relied on an empirical circularity: the company convinced doctors of the drug’s safety with literature that had been produced by doctors who were paid, or funded, by the company.\n\nDavid Juurlink, who runs the division of clinical pharmacology and toxicology at the University of Toronto, told me that OxyContin’s success can be attributed partly to the fact that so many doctors wanted to believe in the therapeutic benefits of opioids. “The primary goal of medical practice is the relief of suffering, and one of the most common types that doctors see is pain,” he said. “You’ve got a patient in pain, you’ve got a doctor who genuinely wants to help, and now suddenly you have an intervention that—we are told—is safe and effective.”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cneembed: script/video/59e67ae82d1ca0598f000024.js?autoplay=0]|||\n|||\n***Watch “The Backstory”:** Philip Montgomery on his portfolio about the American opioid crisis.*\n+++\n\nKeith Humphreys, a professor of psychiatry at Stanford, who served as a drug-policy adviser to the Obama Administration, said, “That’s the real Greek tragedy of this—that so many well-meaning doctors got co-opted. The level of influence is just mind-boggling. Purdue gave money to continuing medical education, to state medical boards, to faux grassroots organizations.” According to training materials, Purdue instructed sales representatives to assure doctors—repeatedly and without evidence—that “fewer than one per cent” of patients who took OxyContin became addicted. (In 1999, a Purdue-funded study of patients who used OxyContin for headaches found that the addiction rate was thirteen per cent.)\n\nWithin five years of its introduction, OxyContin was generating a billion dollars a year. “There is no sign of it slowing down,” Richard Sackler told a team of company representatives in 2000\\. The sales force was heavily incentivized to push the drug. In a memo, a sales manager in Tennessee wrote, “$$$$$$$$$$$$$ It’s Bonus Time in the Neighborhood!” May, who was assigned to the Virginia area, was astonished to learn that especially skillful colleagues were earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in commissions. One year, May’s own sales were so brisk that Purdue rewarded him with a trip to Hawaii. As prescriptions multiplied, Purdue executives—and the Sackler family members on the company’s board—appeared happy to fund such blandishments. Internal budget plans described the company’s sales force as its “most valuable resource.” In 2001, Purdue Pharma paid forty million dollars in bonuses.\n\nOne day, May drove with a colleague to Lewisburg, a small city in West Virginia. They were there to visit a doctor who had been one of May’s top prescribers. When they arrived, the doctor was ashen. A relative had just died, she explained. The girl had overdosed on OxyContin.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nArthur and Mortimer Sackler each married three times, and Raymond married once. There are fifteen Sackler children in the second generation, most of whom have children of their own. The Sackler clan has pursued a variety of causes and interests. In 2011, Mortimer’s widow, Theresa, who sits on the board of Purdue, was awarded the Prince of Wales Medal for Art Philanthropy. When the medal was conferred, Ian Dejardin, the Sackler Director of the Dulwich Picture Gallery, remarked, “It’s going to be difficult not to make her sound utterly saintly.” Theresa’s daughter, Sophie, is married to the English cricket player Jamie Dalrymple, and lives in a forty-million-dollar house in London. Raymond’s thirty-seven-year-old grandson, David Sackler, runs a family investment fund, and is the only member of the third generation who sits on Purdue’s board. The fact that Purdue is privately held is a major reason that the Sacklers’ connection to OxyContin has remained obscure. A publicly traded company makes periodic disclosures to its shareholders. But Purdue, Barry Meier writes, “was the Sackler family’s private domain.”\n\nOn occasion, press accounts about OxyContin note that profits from the drug flow to the Sacklers, but these stories tend to depict the family as a monolith. As with any large clan, however, there are fissures of discord. In the eighties, Mortimer sued his ex-wife Gertraud, claiming that she had illegally taken possession of an apartment that he owned on Fifth Avenue and had loaned it out to a contingent of models and photographers. None of Arthur’s descendants sit on the company’s board. At a courthouse in Long Island, in files stemming from the family fight over Arthur’s fortune, I came across a document indicating that, after a “protracted negotiation,” Arthur’s estate “sold its one third interest in Purdue” to Raymond and Mortimer.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/59ea5c72af5ee84376f973b8]||||||\n+++\n\n“I have never owned any shares in Purdue,” Michael Sackler-Berner, a Brooklyn-based singer-songwriter who is a grandson of Arthur Sackler, told me, in an e-mail. “None of the descendants of Arthur M. Sackler have ever had anything to do with, or benefited from, the sale of OxyContin.” Sackler-Berner made no mention of Librium, Valium, or MS Contin, but he added, “Given the current controversy surrounding OxyContin, I appreciate your clarifying the matter.”\n\nEven though Mortimer Sackler had a large stake in the company, he was only an occasional presence at the Connecticut headquarters. He renounced his U.S. citizenship in 1974, reportedly for tax reasons, and lived a flamboyant life in Europe, shuttling among residences in England, the Swiss Alps, and Cap d’Antibes. (In 1999, Queen Elizabeth conferred an honorary knighthood on him, in recognition of his philanthropy.) Raymond Sackler, who lived in Connecticut, had a more modest temperament and came to his office at Purdue—where he was respectfully known as Dr. Raymond—every day. John Kallir, Arthur’s former advertising colleague, recalled, “Ray was quiet, reasonably honest, always married to the same woman. The least interesting of the three brothers.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAlmost immediately after OxyContin’s release, there were signs that people were abusing it in rural areas like Maine and Appalachia. If you ground the pills up and snorted them, or dissolved them in liquid and injected them, you could override the time-release mechanism and deliver a huge narcotic payload all at once. Perversely, users could learn about such methods by reading a warning label that came with each prescription, which said, “Taking broken, chewed or crushed OxyContin tablets could lead to the rapid release and absorption of a potentially toxic dose.” As more and more doctors prescribed OxyContin for an ever-greater range of symptoms, some patients began selling their pills on the black market, where the street price was a dollar a milligram. Doctors who were easily manipulated by their patients—or corrupted by the money in play—set up so-called pill mills, pain clinics that thrived on a wholesale business of issuing OxyContin prescriptions.\n\nThe company did not pull the drug from shelves, however, or acknowledge that it was addictive. Instead, Purdue insisted that the only problem was that recreational drug users were not taking OxyContin as directed. “Their rap has always been that a bunch of junkies ruined their product,” Keith Humphreys, the Stanford professor, said. In 2001, Michael Friedman, Purdue’s executive vice-president, testified before a congressional hearing convened to look into the alarming increase in opioid abuse. The marketing of OxyContin had been “conservative by any standard,” he maintained. “Virtually all of these reports involve people who are abusing the medication, not patients with legitimate medical needs.”\n\nIn 2002, a twenty-nine-year-old woman from New Jersey, Jill Skolek, was prescribed OxyContin for a back injury. One night, after four months on the drug, she died in her sleep, from respiratory arrest, leaving behind a six-year-old son. Her mother, Marianne Skolek Perez, was a nurse. Distraught and bewildered, she became convinced that OxyContin was dangerous. Perez wrote to F.D.A. officials, urging them to append to OxyContin packaging a warning about the risk of addiction.\n\nThe following year, Perez attended a conference on addiction at Columbia University. A sandy-haired man named Robin Hogen, wearing a pin-striped suit and a bow tie, was there, too. He was a communications specialist for Purdue, and had launched a vigorous campaign to defend the drug, warning newspapers to be careful about their coverage. “We’re going to be watching them,” he had promised. He had also enlisted Rudolph Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, and his associate Bernard Kerik to preëmpt any government crackdown. “We have to be politically Machiavellian, often, to win the day,” Hogen once said. At the Columbia event, he was asked about Perez’s daughter. He cautioned that one should not read into the tragedy any liability on Purdue’s part. The real problem, he said, was Jill Skolek: “We think she abused drugs.” (Hogen subsequently apologized for his remark. He no longer works for Purdue.)\n\nAnother speaker at the event was Purdue’s senior medical adviser, J. David Haddox, who insisted that OxyContin was not addictive. He once likened the drug to a vegetable, saying, “If I gave you a stalk of celery and you ate that, it would be healthy. But if you put it in a blender and tried to shoot it into your veins, it would not be good.” When Haddox was walking out of the event, Perez, who is petite and rail thin, deliberately bumped into him. Caught off guard, Haddox staggered backward and fell, with a clatter, into a row of folding chairs. “It was one of those Kodak moments,” Perez recalled. “It was probably the wrong thing to do. But I loved it.”\n\nArthur Sackler once wrote that “all health problems devolve upon the individual,” and it was Purdue’s position that OxyContin overdoses were a matter of individual responsibility, rather than the drug’s addictive properties. In addition to people like Hogen and Haddox, the company put forward several top executives to mount a defense, including Howard Udell, Purdue’s general counsel, who had been a longtime legal adviser to the Sacklers. Udell “was like Tom Hagen in ‘The Godfather,’ ” an attorney who dealt with him told me. “_Very_ loyal to the family.” Udell was clearly aware, however, of the abuse potential of OxyContin. According to court documents, his own secretary became addicted to the drug, and was subsequently fired by Purdue.\n\nBy 2003, the Drug Enforcement Administration had found that Purdue’s “aggressive methods” had “very much exacerbated OxyContin’s widespread abuse.” Rogelio Guevara, a senior official at the D.E.A., concluded that Purdue had “deliberately minimized” the risks associated with the drug. But the company continued shifting the blame to drug abusers, creating a public-service announcement that showed a teen-ager raiding his parents’ medicine cabinet.\n\nIn a phone interview, Hogen told me that, for Purdue and the Sacklers, “there was a sense almost of betrayal—how could people put the availability of that product in jeopardy by abusing it for pleasure?” Hogen said that the company received many letters from grateful pain patients, thanking Purdue for “giving them their lives back.” Asked about his reticence to acknowledge that OxyContin might be addictive, Hogen said, “Today, addiction is broadly seen as a disease. Then, it was not. I think our understanding of addiction has grown enormously in the last fifteen years.”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/59ea5c724837d07518971ba0]||||||\n+++\n\nPeople have known for thousands of years that opium derivatives are addictive, I said.\n\n“You really need to talk to a clinician,” Hogen replied. “I’m not a doctor.”\n\nJ. David Haddox is a doctor. In 2001, he told an Associated Press reporter, “A lot of these people say, ‘Well, I was taking the medicine like my doctor told me to,’ and then they start taking more and more and more.” He added, “I don’t see where that’s my problem.” (Haddox, who still works for Purdue, declined to comment.)\n\nThe truth was that the dangers of OxyContin were intrinsic to the drug—and Purdue knew it. The time-release formula meant that, in principle, patients could safely ingest one giant dose every twelve hours. They could sleep through the night—a crucial improvement over conventional painkillers, such as morphine, which require more frequent dosing. One of Purdue’s initial advertising campaigns featured a photograph of two little dosage cups, one marked “8 *A*{: .small}.*M*{: .small}.” and the other “8 *P*{: .small}.*M*{: .small}.,” and the words “Remember, Effective Relief Just Takes Two.” But internal Purdue documents, which have emerged through litigation, show that even before the company received F.D.A. approval it was aware that not all patients who took OxyContin were achieving twelve-hour relief. [A recent exposé](http://www.latimes.com/projects/oxycontin-part1/) by the Los Angeles _Times_ revealed that the first patients to use OxyContin, in a study conducted by Purdue, were ninety women recovering from surgery in Puerto Rico. Roughly half the women required more medication before the twelve-hour mark. The study was never published. For Purdue, the business reason for obscuring such results was clear: the claim of twelve-hour relief was an invaluable marketing tool. But prescribing a pill on a twelve-hour schedule when, for many patients, it works for only eight is a recipe for withdrawal, addiction, and abuse. Notwithstanding Purdue’s claims, many people who were not drug abusers—and who took OxyContin exactly as their doctors instructed—began experiencing withdrawal symptoms between doses. In March, 2001, a Purdue employee e-mailed a supervisor, describing some internal data on withdrawal and wondering whether or not to write up the results, even though doing so would only “add to the current negative press.” The supervisor responded, “I would not write it up at this point.”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#gallery: /galleries/59ea752c34ab9a14429f49a0]|||\nIn testimonials collected by Purdue Pharma in 2001, pain patients praise OxyContin, but they also describe needing more than the recommended dose—once every twelve hours.\n|||\n+++\n\nDoctors who prescribed OxyContin were beginning to report that patients were coming to them with symptoms of withdrawal (itching, nausea, the shakes) and asking for more medication. Haddox had an answer. In a 1989 paper, he had coined the term “pseudo-addiction.” As a pain-management pamphlet distributed by Purdue explained, pseudo-addiction “seems similar to addiction, but is due to unrelieved pain.” The pamphlet continued, “Misunderstanding of this phenomenon may lead the clinician to inappropriately stigmatize the patient with the label ‘addict.’ ” Pseudo-addiction generally stopped once the pain was relieved—“often through an increase in opioid dose.”\n\n“When you promote these very massive doses of opioids, the more of it that is out there the more abuse there will be,” David Kessler said. “It’s almost linear.” U.S. sales of OxyContin soon exceeded those of Viagra. Everywhere the drug spread, addiction followed. To Steven May, the sales representative in Virginia, it seemed as if the problems associated with OxyContin were metastasizing, “like a cancer.”\n\nAccording to Robin Hogen, the members of the Sackler family “were unified in their shock that this was happening to a product they were very proud of.” The Sacklers did not have an arm’s-length relationship with Purdue, Hogen said: “This was an active family and an active board.” In 1999, Richard Sackler became Purdue’s president. As the head of a privately held company, however, he felt no pressure to be the public face of the business, and he never appeared at forums where people like Haddox defended Purdue. Indeed, though Sackler presided over the tremendously successful launch of OxyContin, he has never given an on-the-record interview about the drug. “I’ve had a lot of experience with Purdue over the years, in different settings, but I’ve never even _seen_ Richard Sackler,” the addiction specialist Andrew Kolodny, who is a frequent Purdue critic, told me. “I don’t think I’d know him if he was standing in front of me.”\n\nEven after it became clear that OxyContin was being widely abused, Purdue refused to concede that it posed risks. Company leaders worried mainly that attempts to stem overdoses might deprive pain patients of access to the drug. “They said, ‘We need to make sure that these products are available for patients,’ ” Hogen said. “That was their sole focus.” According to Steven May, the sales force was instructed to ride out the controversy, ignore abuse reports, and “sell through it.” As late as 2003, the F.D.A. sent Purdue a warning letter about ads that “grossly overstate the safety profile of OxyContin by not referring in the body of the advertisements to serious, potentially fatal risks.”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/59ea5c7257e38e49cd3157bb]||||||\n+++\n\nIn his congressional testimony, Michael Friedman, Richard Sackler’s deputy, said that Purdue first became aware of problems with OxyContin only in April, 2000, after a series of press reports about people abusing it recreationally in Maine. But Purdue didn’t need the media’s help to know that something was seriously off with the distribution of OxyContin. For years, it had maintained a contract with I.M.S., a little-known company, co-founded by Arthur Sackler, that furnished its clients with fine-grained information about the prescribing habits of individual doctors. Purdue’s sales representatives used the data to figure out which doctors to target.\n\nSuch data could also be used to track patterns of abuse. “They know _exactly_ what people are prescribing,” Kolodny said. “They know when a doctor is running a pill mill.” At the 2001 hearing, James Greenwood, a Pennsylvania congressman, asked Friedman whether Purdue would take any action if, say, I.M.S. data revealed that a rural osteopath was writing thousands of prescriptions.\n\nFriedman replied that it was not up to Purdue to assess “how well a physician practices medicine.”\n\n“Why do you want that information, then?” Greenwood pressed, before answering his own question: “To see how successful your marketing techniques are.”\n\nGreenwood then observed that, in a recent case involving a Pennsylvania doctor, Richard Paolino, who was wantonly overprescribing OxyContin, a local pharmacist had alerted the authorities. “He looked at this data and he said, ‘Holy God, there is some guy in Bensalem called Paolino, and he’s writing prescriptions out the wazoo,’ ” Greenwood said. “Now, he had that data and he blew the whistle. And you had that data. What did _you_ do?”\n\nPurdue had not alerted the authorities. Clinicians like Paolino were breaking the law—he was sentenced to a minimum of thirty years in prison. But overprescribing generated tremendous revenue for the company. According to four people I spoke with, at Purdue such prescribers were given a name that Las Vegas casinos reserve for their most prized gamblers: whales.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn July, 2001, Richard Blumenthal, who was then the attorney general of Connecticut, wrote to Richard Sackler. “I have been increasingly dismayed and alarmed about the problems and escalating abuse of OxyContin,” he began, citing overdose deaths, addiction, pharmacy robberies, and “the astonishing growth in state funding” that was being used to pay for OxyContin prescriptions through Medicaid and Medicare. Blumenthal acknowledged that other prescription drugs were also abused. “But OxyContin is different,” he wrote. “It is more powerful, more addictive, more widely sold, more illicitly available, and more publicized.” He urged Purdue to “overhaul and reform” its marketing of OxyContin.\n\nThe Sacklers disregarded his recommendation, and so in 2004 Blumenthal filed a complaint against Purdue, on behalf of the State of Connecticut. It cited data indicating that a fifth of OxyContin prescriptions were now for dosing intervals shorter than twelve hours. In fact, Blumenthal obtained Purdue records indicating that company officials knew by 1998 that prescriptions for eight-hour intervals were becoming more and more frequent. In one document, a Purdue employee called the numbers “very scary.”\n\nSuch alarm over off-label dosing may have been prompted less by concern about public health than by considerations of profit. If OxyContin was being widely prescribed at intervals of fewer than twelve hours, the company might lose its “two pills a day” marketplace advantage against cheaper alternatives, like generic morphine, and insurers could start refusing to cover the costs. As early as 1997, some benefit plans had begun citing abuse of OxyContin as an excuse not to pay. In a 1997 e-mail, Richard Sackler urged colleagues to counter this resistance, warning that, for insurance companies, “ ‘addiction’ may be a convenient way to just say ‘NO.’ ”\n\nPurdue has been sued thousands of times over OxyContin since its release. (Steven May, the sales rep, initiated a whistle-blower suit years after leaving the company; it was dismissed, on procedural grounds.) In 2002, Howard Udell said that the firm would defend itself “to the hilt.” The next year, a New York trial lawyer named Paul Hanly assembled a lawsuit, signing up five thousand patients who said that they’d become addicted to OxyContin after receiving a doctor’s prescription. In discovery, Hanly obtained thousands of documents. “They demonstrated that this company had set out to perpetrate a fraud on the entire medical community,” he told me. “These pronouncements about how safe the drug was emanated from the marketing department, not the scientific department. It was pretty shocking. They just made this stuff up.”\n\nIn 2006, Purdue settled with Hanly’s clients, for seventy-five million dollars. Shortly afterward, the company pleaded guilty, in a case brought by federal prosecutors in Virginia, to criminal charges of misbranding, and acknowledged that Purdue had marketed OxyContin “with the intent to defraud or mislead.” (Rudolph Giuliani had tried, on Purdue’s behalf, to get the lead prosecutor to scuttle the case.) Michael Friedman, the executive vice-president, pleaded guilty to a criminal misdemeanor, as did Howard Udell and the company’s chief medical officer, Paul Goldenheim.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/59ea5c724a5d97161ab970ba]||||||\n+++\n\nMarianne Perez attended the sentencing, in Virginia. “I was on cloud nine,” she recalled. She had been working with the prosecution, and doing everything she could to inform the public about the dangers of OxyContin. Before the sentence was handed down, Perez delivered a victim-impact statement. “I want to know why the Sackler brothers have not been held accountable,” she said. (Richard Sackler, despite his leadership role at Purdue, had not been charged.)\n\nDuring a break in the proceedings, Perez looked over at Friedman, Goldenheim, and Udell, and told herself, “I could reach over, at ninety-eight pounds, and smack one of them.” This time, she restrained herself. Instead, she told them, “You are sheer evil. You are bastards.” The executives reddened, but said nothing. They all received probation, and were ordered, collectively, to pay nearly thirty-five million dollars in fines. Purdue agreed to pay an additional six hundred million. Given the billions of dollars that the Sacklers and Purdue had reaped from OxyContin, some observers felt that the company had got off easy. Arlen Specter, the Republican senator from Pennsylvania, remarked that such fines amounted to “expensive licenses for criminal misconduct.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nArthur Sackler wrote a regular column for the _Medical Tribune_, and one of his fixations was the unethical behavior of tobacco companies. In 1979, he critiqued the “weasel-worded warning” on cigarette packages as insufficient, arguing that the “hazard to health should be more specific.” He also condemned newspapers and magazines for accepting “misleading” advertising about cigarettes, and contended that the publishers must “square with their own consciences their contribution to our national mortality.”\n\nIn 1998, the tobacco industry, which had been sued by dozens of states, entered into the largest civil-litigation settlement in history, agreeing to pay two hundred and forty-six billion dollars. Tobacco and opioids are different in significant ways. The F.D.A. approved OxyContin as a medicine, and, whereas tobacco can kill you even when used as directed, Purdue would argue that this isn’t the case with OxyContin. Mike Moore, who, as Mississippi’s attorney general, played a key role in the tobacco litigation, noted another difference: the tobacco companies had more money to spare than Purdue does. “To resolve the opioid problem, you’re going to need billions,” he said. “Treatment alone could be fifty billion dollars or more. And you need prevention and education programs on top of that.”\n\nMoore is now working with Paul Hanly and other attorneys to bring a fresh wave of lawsuits against Purdue and other pharmaceutical companies. Ten states have filed suits, and private attorneys are working in partnership with dozens of cities and counties to bring others. Many public officials are furious at the makers of powerful painkillers. Prescriptions are expensive, and taxpayers often foot the bill, through programs like Medicaid. Then, as the ruinous consequences of opioid addiction take hold, the public must pay again—this time for emergency services, addiction treatment, and the like. Moore feels that the Sackler family, as the initial author and a prime beneficiary of the epidemic, should be publicly shamed. “I don’t call it Purdue. I call it the Sackler Company,” he said. “They are the main culprit. They duped the F.D.A., saying it lasted twelve hours. They lied about the addictive properties. And they did all this to grow the opioid market, to make it O.K. to jump in the water. Then some of these other companies, they saw that the water was warm, and they said, ‘O.K., we can jump in, too.’ ” There may be significant legal distinctions between a tobacco company and an opioid producer, but to Moore the ethical parallel is unmistakable: “They’re both profiting by killing people.”\n\nOne day in August, 2015, a plane landed in Louisville, Kentucky, and Richard Sackler stepped out, surrounded by attorneys. Eight years earlier, the State of Kentucky had sued Purdue, charging the company with deceptive marketing. Greg Stumbo, the state attorney general at the time, initiated the suit; the son of a cousin of his had fatally overdosed on OxyContin. Purdue fought the suit with its customary rigor, pushing to move the proceedings elsewhere, on the ground that the company could not get a fair trial in Pike County, Kentucky—the rural stretch of coal country where the state intended to try the case. In support of this motion, the company commissioned a demographic study of Pike County and submitted it to the court, as an illustration of potential bias in the jury pool. The report was revealing in ways that Purdue may not have intended: according to the filing, twenty-nine per cent of the county’s residents said that they or their family members knew someone who had died from using OxyContin. Seven out of ten respondents described OxyContin’s effect on their community as “devastating.”\n\nA judge ruled that Purdue could not shift the venue for the trial, and so Richard Sackler flew to Louisville. He gave a deposition at a law firm. Four lawyers questioned him about his role in the development and the marketing of OxyContin. Tyler Thompson, the lead attorney, told me that Sackler’s demeanor during the session reminded him of Jeremy Irons’s portrayal of Claus von Bülow, the aristocrat accused of murdering his wife, in the 1990 bio-pic “[Reversal of Fortune.](https://www.amazon.com/Reversal-Fortune-Jeremy-Irons/dp/B000056BP3)” “A smirk and a so-what attitude—an absolute lack of remorse,” Thompson said. “It reminded me of these mining companies that come in here and do mountaintop removal, and leave a mess and just move on: ‘It’s not my back yard, so I don’t care.’ ” Mitchel Denham, a former litigator in the Kentucky attorney general’s office, also attended the deposition. “It was surreal,” he recalled. “We were face to face with the guy whose company had helped to create the opioid epidemic.” Denham told me that, in preparing for trial, he discovered a photograph of the 1997 Pikeville High School football team. “Nearly half the players had died of overdoses, or were addicted,” he said. “It was going to be a pretty good visual.”\n\nBut Denham never presented the photograph to a jury, because before the case could go to trial Purdue settled, for twenty-four million dollars. This was a coup for the Sacklers. The settlement was more than Purdue’s original offer—half a million dollars—but still totally incommensurate with Pike County’s needs; Purdue admitted no liability; and, in settling, the company sealed from public view both Richard Sackler’s deposition and internal documents obtained through discovery. Purdue has sometimes claimed to have never “lost a case” related to OxyContin, but it’s more accurate to say that the company has never allowed a case to go to trial, often settling rather than litigating the culpability of the company—and the Sacklers—in open court. “That’s the main reason these folks don’t go to trial,” Denham said. “Because all these documents could end up in the public record.” The Kentucky prosecutors were required to destroy millions of documents, or return them to Purdue. The medical-news Web site STAT subsequently sued to unseal Richard Sackler’s deposition. A state judge ruled in its favor, but Purdue appealed. I spent several months trying to obtain a copy of the deposition, but, because it remains under a protective order while Purdue appeals the matter, no lawyer would share it with me. Mike Moore said, “The idea that they’re fighting so hard to keep this deposition hidden should tell you something.”\n\nRichard Sackler stepped down as Purdue’s president in 2003, but stayed on as co-chairman of the company’s board. After spending several years as an adjunct professor of genetics at Rockefeller University, he moved to Austin, Texas, in 2013\\. He lives in a modern hilltop mansion on the outskirts of the city, in an area favored by tech entrepreneurs. According to tax disclosures from his personal foundation, he has continued giving money to Yale, but his largest donation in 2015 was a hundred-thousand-dollar gift to a neoconservative think tank, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Through a representative, Sackler declined to speak with me. I contacted a dozen other members of the Sackler family, but none of them would answer questions about OxyContin. Jo Sheldon, a London-based media adviser, called me, and said that she works with some of the Sacklers. (She would not identify which ones.) When I told her that I had questions for the Sacklers, she said that my inquiries would be better directed to Purdue. She said of the Sacklers, “Some of them are still quite involved in Purdue, but some have absolutely nothing to do with it,” apart from depositing checks.\n\nGiven the sometimes fractious nature of the Sackler family, it was striking that they were united in their silence on the subject of OxyContin. These were urbane, expensively educated, presumably well-informed people. Could they conceivably be unaware of the accumulated evidence about the tainted origins of their fortune? Did they simply put it out of mind? “Greed can get people to rationalize pretty bad behavior,” Andrew Kolodny had told me. Someone who knows Mortimer, Jr., socially told me, “I think for him, most of the time, he’s just saying, ‘Wow, we’re really rich. It’s fucking cool. I don’t really want to think that much about the other side of things.’ ”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/59ea5c72ca1b673b45f0e61d]||||||\n+++\n\nPaul Hanly, the lawyer, said that the Sacklers’ steadfast refusal to address the legacy of OxyContin may just be a legal tactic—and a shrewd one. “The more interviews you give, the more targets you create for lawyers like me, and for government investigators,” he said. I wondered whether philanthropy might represent, for at least some of the Sacklers, a form of atonement. But, when you consider the breadth of the family’s donations, one field is conspicuously lacking: addiction treatment, or any other measures that might serve to counter the opioid epidemic.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn August, 2010, Purdue quietly replaced OxyContin with a drug that was subtly different. The company had been granted patents for a reformulated version of OxyContin. If you crushed these new pills, they became not a fine, dissolvable powder but an unwieldy gummy substance. Purdue had received F.D.A. approval for the reformulation, in part, by touting the ostensible safety of the new product. The F.D.A. had approved a label, the first of its kind, that included a claim about the drug’s “abuse deterrent” properties.\n\nIn an interview, Craig Landau, Purdue’s C.E.O., told me, “A very large proportion of Purdue’s R. & D. efforts post-2001 was dedicated toward addressing the specific vulnerability of the original OxyContin product.” To a casual observer, it might have seemed that the makers of OxyContin, after years of obstructing efforts to curb the disastrous impacts of their painkiller, had finally seen the error of their ways. But Purdue was almost certainly motivated by another consideration: it needed to block competition from generic drugs. Arthur Sackler had often used the pages of the _Medical Tribune_ to criticize generics. In 1985, the paper had published a story, “Schizophrenics ‘Wild’ on Weak Generic,” describing how “all hell broke loose” at a veterans’ hospital after the psychiatric unit switched from a brand-name antipsychotic to a generic. ([According to the _Times_,](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/28/business/drug-makers-fighting-back-against-advance-of-generics.html?pagewanted=all) the F.D.A. investigated and found that the story was bogus, because “the generic had been introduced six months before the purported problems began.”) I spoke with a leading patent lawyer who frequently represents manufacturers of generic drugs, and she said that companies often make a minor tweak to a branded product shortly before the patent expires, in order to obtain a new patent and reset the clock on their exclusive right to produce the drug. The patent for the original OxyContin was set to expire in 2013.\n\nPurdue had long denied that the original OxyContin was especially prone to abuse. But, upon receiving its patents for the reformulated drug, the company filed papers with the F.D.A., asking the agency to refuse to accept generic versions of the original formulation—because they were unsafe. The F.D.A., ever obliging, agreed, blocking any low-cost generic competition for Purdue. For more than a year, Purdue continued to sell the original formulation of OxyContin in Canada. According to a recent study, OxyContin sales in Windsor, Ontario—just across the border from Detroit—suddenly quadrupled, a clear indication that the pills were being purchased for the U.S. black market. Through I.M.S. tracking data, Purdue would have been able to monitor the Canadian surge, and to deduce the reason for it. (The company acknowledges that it was aware of the spike in sales, and maintains that it alerted authorities, but will not say when it did so.)\n\nBy the time Purdue reformulated OxyContin, the country was in the middle of a full-blown epidemic. Andrew Kolodny, the addiction specialist, told me that many older people remain addicted to the reformulated OxyContin, and continue to obtain the drug through prescriptions. These people purchase the drug legally, and swallow the pills whole, as instructed. “That’s Purdue’s market now,” Kolodny said. Younger people, who can less readily secure prescriptions for pain—and for whom OxyContin may be too expensive—have increasingly turned to black-market substitutes, including heroin. As Sam Quinones details in his 2015 book, “[Dreamland: The True Tale of America’s Opiate Epidemic,](https://www.amazon.com/Dreamland-True-Americas-Opiate-Epidemic/dp/1620402521/)” heroin dealers from Mexico fanned out across the U.S. to supply a burgeoning market of people who had been primed by pill addiction. This is one dreadful paradox of the history of OxyContin: the original formulation created a generation addicted to pills; the reformulation, by forcing younger users off the drug, helped create a generation addicted to heroin. A recent paper by a team of economists, citing a dramatic uptick in heroin overdoses since 2010, is titled “[How the Reformulation of OxyContin Ignited the Heroin Epidemic](https://www3.nd.edu/~elieber/research/ELP.pdf).” A survey of two hundred and forty-four people who entered treatment for OxyContin abuse after the reformulation found that a third had switched to other drugs. Seventy per cent of that group had turned to heroin.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising aspect of Quinones’s investigation is the similarities he finds between the tactics of the unassuming, business-minded Mexican heroin peddlers, the so-called Xalisco boys, and the slick corporate sales force of Purdue. When the Xalisco boys arrived in a new town, they identified their market by seeking out the local methadone clinic. Purdue, using I.M.S. data, similarly targeted populations that were susceptible to its product. Mitchel Denham, the Kentucky lawyer, told me that Purdue pinpointed “communities where there is a lot of poverty and a lack of education and opportunity,” adding, “They were looking at numbers that showed these people have work-related injuries, they go to the doctor more often, they get treatment for pain.” The Xalisco boys offered potential customers free samples of their product. So did Purdue. When it first introduced OxyContin, the company created a program that encouraged doctors to issue coupons for a free initial prescription. By the time Purdue discontinued the program, four years later, thirty-four thousand coupons had been redeemed.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nPurdue Pharma now acknowledges that there is an opioid crisis, but maintains that it has taken every available step to address it, from sponsoring “prescription monitoring” programs in some states to underwriting drug-abuse education. Craig Landau, the C.E.O., told me, “If the Holy Grail is a pain medicine that is safe and effective for patients with severe pain but carries no abuse risk, we haven’t found it yet.” He added that the company has been trying to develop “non-opioid pain products.” Purdue likes to emphasize that there are many other powerful painkillers, and that OxyContin never had more than two per cent of the market for opioids. This is true in terms of the number of prescriptions. But most painkillers are prescribed for very short periods—following surgery, for instance—and in relatively small doses, whereas OxyContin’s sales have been driven by long-term, high-dose prescriptions. If one measured market share by the actual volume of narcotics administered, OxyContin’s would be considerably higher. Some doctors I spoke with estimated that it could be as high as thirty per cent.\n\nThe United States accounts for roughly a third of the global market for opioid painkillers. But, as politicians and journalists have raised alarms over the addiction crisis, many American doctors have grown leery, again, of prescribing these drugs. In a statement, Purdue acknowledged that even patients “who take OxyContin in accordance with its F.D.A.-approved labeling instructions will likely develop physical dependence.” The company maintains that physical dependence is different from addiction, but Jane Ballantyne, the president of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, said that, for patients, this can be a meaningless distinction: if they find themselves unable to stop taking a drug, for fear of crippling withdrawal, “at a certain point that might as well be addiction.” The drugstore chain CVS, which has been accused of profiteering from opioids, recently announced that it plans to limit prescriptions for powerful doses to one week’s worth, a change that could have a major impact on the abuse of these drugs. It may also be that OxyContin has achieved market saturation. In recent years, American clinicians have issued about a quarter of a billion opioid prescriptions annually. Last year, in Ohio, a state particularly hard hit by the epidemic, 2.3 million residents—roughly one in five people in the state—received a prescription for opioids. In 2012, the Milwaukee _Journal Sentinel_ [published a story](http://archive.jsonline.com/watchdog/watchdogreports/what-happened-to-the-poster-children-of-oxycontin-r65r0lo-169056206.html/) about pain patients who had offered testimonials about the wonders of OxyContin in Purdue promotional videos. Johnny Sullivan, the construction worker who had talked about OxyContin easing his back pain, became addicted to the drug. In 2008, while driving home from a hunting trip, he apparently blacked out; he flipped his truck, and died instantly. In a Purdue brochure, Sullivan is quoted as saying that OxyContin pills “don’t put me in a stupor or make me groggy.”\n\nDavid Juurlink, the Toronto doctor, told me that opioids are problematic even for users who don’t succumb to addiction. “Opioids really do afford pain relief—initially,” he said. “But that relief tends to diminish over time. That’s, in part, why people increase the dose. They are chasing pain relief from a drug that has failed. I see all these people who are convinced they are one of the ‘legitimate’ pain patients. They’re on a massive dose of opioids, and they’re telling me they need this medication, which is clearly doing them _harm_. For many of them, the primary benefit of therapy, at this point, is not going into withdrawal.”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/59ea5c727d8be54626f57a4f]||||||\n+++\n\nEven Russell Portenoy, the Purdue-funded doctor who advocated for wider long-term use of opioids, has reassessed his views. “Did I teach about pain management, specifically about opioid therapy, in a way that reflects misinformation?” [he said to the _Wall Street Journal_](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324478304578173342657044604) in 2012\\. “I guess I did.” (In a statement, Portenoy told me that he has “refocussed” his approach to pain management, adding, “No funder has had any undue influence over my thinking.”)\n\nIn his defense, Portenoy has pointed out that, two decades ago, doctors did not know what they know now about opioids and addiction. The Sackler family and Purdue Pharma could have taken responsibility in a similar spirit: apologizing for their role in unleashing a national catastrophe while noting that, during the nineties, they had relied on a series of mistaken assumptions about the safety of OxyContin. But Purdue has continued to fight aggressively against any measures that might limit the distribution of OxyContin, in a way that calls to mind the gun lobby’s resistance to firearm regulations. Confronted with the prospect of modest, commonsense measures that might in any way impinge on the prescribing of painkillers, Purdue and its various allies have responded with alarm, suggesting that such steps will deny law-abiding pain patients access to medicine they desperately need. Mark Sullivan, a psychiatrist at the University of Washington, distilled the argument of Purdue: “Our product isn’t dangerous—it’s _people_ who are dangerous.”\n\nLast year, the C.D.C., which formally declared an opioid epidemic in 2011, introduced the first set of guidelines to help reduce the prescribing of strong painkillers like OxyContin. “Opioids should not be considered first-line or routine therapy for chronic pain,” the guidelines said, recommending that doctors first consider “non-pharmacologic” approaches, such as physical therapy, and “non-opioid pharmacologic” treatments.\n\nPurdue and other pharmaceutical companies have long funded ostensibly neutral nonprofit groups that advocate for pain patients. The C.D.C. guidelines were nonbinding, yet many of these organizations fought to prevent the agency from releasing them. This kind of obstruction is typical at both the state and the federal level. A recent series by the Associated Press and the Center for Public Integrity revealed that, after Purdue made its guilty plea, in 2007, it assembled an army of lobbyists to fight any legislative actions that might encroach on its business. Between 2006 and 2015, Purdue and other painkiller producers, along with their associated nonprofits, spent nearly nine hundred million dollars on lobbying and political contributions—eight times what the gun lobby spent during that period.\n\nSince Purdue made it more difficult to grind OxyContin pills, prescriptions have reportedly plummeted by forty per cent. This suggests that nearly half of the original drug’s consumers may have been crushing it to get high. As David Juurlink pointed out to me, it is a misnomer to call the reformulation an “abuse deterrent.” It can still be abused—and is, widely, by people who become addicted by swallowing the pills, just as the bottle instructs. But Purdue, facing a shrinking market and rising opprobrium, has not given up the search for new users. In August, 2015, over objections from critics, the company received F.D.A. approval to market OxyContin to children as young as eleven.\n\n-=-=-=\n\n_Forbes_ [estimates](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2016/06/29/fortune-of-family-behind-oxycontin-drops-amid-declining-prescriptions/#6cfc4e836341) that the Sacklers continue to receive some seven hundred million dollars a year from the family companies, and, as the Sacklers are surely aware, the real future of OxyContin may be global. Many big companies, once their sales plateau in America, look abroad. After introducing OxyContin in the U.S., Purdue moved into Canada and England. At the University of Toronto, the company sponsored a class on pain management for medical and dental students. The instructor was a member of Purdue’s speakers’ bureau. Students received a complimentary textbook, produced by Purdue, that described oxycodone as a “moderate” opioid. The course was discontinued after students and doctors criticized it; one of the critics was Rick Glazier, a physician at the university, whose son, Daniel, had fatally overdosed on OxyContin in 2009.\n\nAs OxyContin spread outside the U.S., the pattern of dysfunction repeated itself: to map the geographic distribution of the drug was also to map a rash of addiction, abuse, and death. But the Sackler family has only increased its efforts abroad, and is now pushing the drug, through a Purdue-related company called Mundipharma, into Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. Part of Purdue’s strategy from the beginning has been to create a market for OxyContin—to instill a perceived need by making bold claims about the existence of large numbers of people suffering from untreated chronic pain. As Purdue moves into countries like China and Brazil, where opioids may still retain the kind of stigma that the company so assiduously broke down in the United States, its marketing approach has not changed. According to a [Los Angeles _Times_ report](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-oxycontin-part3/) from 2016—well after the Sacklers’ playbook for OxyContin had been repudiated by the medical establishment as possibly the main driver of the opioid epidemic—Mundipharma commissioned studies showing that millions of people in these countries suffered from chronic pain. The company has organized junkets, and paid doctors to give presentations extolling OxyContin’s virtues. In fact, certain doctors who are currently flogging OxyContin abroad—“pain ambassadors,” they are called—used to be on Purdue’s payroll as advocates for the drug in the U.S.\n\nThe _Times_ report described Joseph Pergolizzi, Jr.—a Florida doctor who runs a pain-management clinic and hawks a pain-relieving cream of his own invention on cable TV—giving paid talks in places like Brazil about the merits of OxyContin. In Mexico, Mundipharma has asserted that twenty-eight million people—a quarter of the population—suffer from chronic pain. In China, the company has distributed cartoon videos about using opioids for pain relief; other promotional literature cites the erroneous claim that rates of addiction are negligible. In a 2014 interview, Raman Singh, a Mundipharma executive, said, “Every single patient that is in emerging markets should have access to our medicines.” The term “opiophobia” has largely fallen into disuse in America, for obvious reasons. Mundipharma executives still use it abroad.\n\n“It’s a parallel to what the tobacco industry did,” Mike Moore told me. “They got caught in America, they saw their market share decline, so they export it to places with even fewer regulations than we have.” He added, “You know what’s going to happen. You’re going to see lots and lots of death.” In May, several members of Congress wrote to the World Health Organization, urging it to help stop the spread of OxyContin, and mentioning the Sackler family by name. “The international health community has a rare opportunity to see the future,” they wrote. “Do not allow Purdue to walk away from the tragedy they have inflicted on countless American families simply to find new markets and new victims elsewhere.” David Kessler, the former F.D.A. commissioner, believes that the destigmatization of opioids in the U.S. represents one of the “great mistakes” of modern medicine. When I asked for his thoughts on Mundipharma’s efforts to market OxyContin abroad, he said, “It gives me a sick feeling. It makes me ill.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nEarlier this year, Peter Salovey, the president of Yale, announced that the university will rename [a residential college that was named for John C. Calhoun](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/names-in-the-ivy-league), because Calhoun’s “legacy as a white supremacist and a national leader who passionately promoted slavery as a ‘positive good’ fundamentally conflicts with Yale’s mission and values.” This move, which was not without its critics, was emblematic of a broader trend to look back skeptically at individuals who were venerated in earlier epochs, and ask how they should be judged by the moral standards of today. At Oxford, a Rhodes Scholar from South Africa recently led a campaign to take down a statue of Cecil Rhodes.\n\nOne great fortune—and reputation—that has evaded such scrutiny is that of the Sacklers, a family whose dubious business practices are not an artifact of previous centuries but an ongoing reality. If present statistics are any indication, in the time it likely took you to read this article six Americans have fatally overdosed on opioids. Yet Yale appears to be in no hurry to rename its Raymond and Beverly Sackler Institute for Biological, Physical and Engineering Sciences, or its Richard Sackler and Jonathan Sackler Professorship of Internal Medicine. Perhaps it’s because the Sacklers, unlike the Calhoun family, still have a fortune to give away.\n\n“It’s amazing how they are left out of the debate about causation, but also about solutions,” Allen Frances, the Duke psychiatrist, said of the Sacklers. “A truly philanthropic family, looking at the last twenty years, would say, ‘You know, there’s several million Americans who are addicted, directly or indirectly, because of us.’ Real philanthropy would be to contribute money to taking care of them. At this point, adding their name to a building—it rings hollow. It’s not philanthropy. It’s just a glorification of the Sackler family.” According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, more than two and a half million Americans have an opioid-use disorder. Frances continued, “If the Sacklers wanted to clear their name, they could take a very substantial fraction of that fortune and create a mechanism for providing free treatment for everyone who’s become addicted.” Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, created the Nobel Peace Prize. In recent years, several philanthropic organizations run by the descendants of John D. Rockefeller have devoted resources to addressing climate change and critiquing the environmental record of the oil company he founded, now called ExxonMobil. Last year, Valerie Rockefeller Wayne [told CBS,](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rockefeller-family-feud-with-exxon-mobil-fossil-fuels-global-warming-climate-change/) “Because the source of the family wealth is fossil fuels, we feel an enormous moral responsibility.”\n\nMike Moore, the former Mississippi attorney general, believes that the Sacklers will feel no pressure to emulate this gesture until more of the public becomes aware that their fortune is derived from the opioid crisis. Moore recalled his initial settlement conference with tobacco-company C.E.O.s: “We asked them, ‘What do you want?’ And they said, ‘We want to be able to go to cocktail parties and not have people come up and ask us why we’re killing people.’ That’s an exact quote.” Moore is puzzled that museums and universities are able to continue accepting money from the Sacklers without questions or controversy. He wondered, “What would happen if some of these foundations, medical schools, and hospitals started to say, ‘How many babies have become addicted to opioids?’ ” A baby with a physical dependency on opioids is now born every half hour. In places like Huntington, West Virginia, ten per cent of newborns are dependent on opioids. A district attorney in eastern Tennessee recently filed a lawsuit against Purdue, and other companies, on behalf of “Baby Doe”—an infant addict.\n\nPurdue executives won’t be able to settle every case against them, Moore believes. “There’s going to be a jury somewhere, someplace, that’s going to hit them with the largest judgment in the nation’s history,” he said. Paul Hanly noted that, in the face of a crippling judgment, Purdue may have to declare bankruptcy. “But I’m certainly not going to walk away if they do,” he said. “At that point, I would start looking closely at individual liability on the part of the Sacklers.”\n\nRobin Hogen, the former Purdue communications executive, said, “I don’t want to be portrayed as an apologist for what is clearly a public-health crisis. But I wanted to make sure you spoke to someone who had very high regard for the Sackler family. The Sacklers were first class in everything they did.” I asked him what he would say to the doctors and the public-health officials who believe that the heirs of Raymond and Mortimer Sackler bear some moral responsibility for the epidemic. “I’m not a doctor,” Hogen demurred. “I really can’t comment.”\n\nThe Sacklers have always excelled at the confidence game of marketing, and it struck me that the greatest trick they ever pulled was to write the family out of the history of the family business. I was reminded of Arthur Sackler’s admonition that you should endeavor to leave the world a better place than it was when you came into it, and I wondered about the moral arithmetic of the Sacklers’ deeds. But the family, through a Purdue representative, declined to comment.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nI recently went to Amagansett, on Long Island, to meet a man I’ll call Jeff. At a restaurant, he told me about his struggles with addiction. A decade ago, when he was a teen-ager, he started abusing opioids. They were “everywhere,” he recalled. He particularly liked OxyContin, for the “clean high” it provided. After sucking the pill’s red coating off, he crushed the rest with the edge of a cigarette lighter, then snorted it. He didn’t inject it. “When I was growing up, I always told myself, ‘I’ll never stick a needle in my arm,’ ” he said.\n\nIn a soft, unflinching tone, Jeff recounted the next decade of his life: he kept abusing painkillers, met a woman, fell in love, and introduced her to opioids. One day, his dealer was out of pills and said, “I’ll sell you a bag of heroin for twenty bucks.” Jeff was reluctant, but when withdrawal set in he acquiesced. At first, he and his girlfriend snorted heroin. “But you build up a tolerance, just like with the pills,” he said, and eventually they started injecting it. They were high when they got married. Jeff’s wife gave birth to a boy, who had an opioid dependency. “The doctors weaned him off with droplets of morphine,” he said.\n\nAfter a long stretch in rehab, Jeff has been sober for more than a year. His baby is healthy, and his wife is clean, too. Looking back, he said, he feels that an impulsive youthful decision to snort pills set him on a path from which he could not deviate. “It was all about the drug,” he said. “I just created a hurricane of destruction.”\n\nWe left the restaurant and strolled along a leafy side street flanked by grand houses. During the worst years of his addiction, Jeff worked as a tradesman in the area. I had asked him to show me a property that he had serviced, and we stopped outside a sprawling estate that was mostly hidden behind dense shrubbery. It was the home of Mortimer Sackler, Jr. Jeff, who knew about the family, appreciated the irony. “I couldn’t tell you how many times I was on that property, sitting in a work truck, snorting a pill,” he said.\n\nWe reached an ornamental wooden gate, beyond which was a yard dominated by a stately weeping willow. As I was admiring the tree, Jeff said that, for the people who maintained the grounds, it was “a pain in the ass.” Whenever the wind picks up, he explained, branches break and scatter all over the lawn. “But the place has to be flawless,” he said. “There can’t be a leaf on the ground.” So a crew comes by regularly, to clear away the mess. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article mischaracterized opioid dependency among infants.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5907ef12019dfc3494e9c8f2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"A Reporter at Large","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"a-reporter-at-large"},{"id":"5944867342fa443beba19b29","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"A Reporter at Large","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"a-reporter-at-large"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590c96f66c4c222f03a8234e","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Patrick Radden Keefe, a staff writer, has been contributing to *The New Yorker* since 2006\\.

Along with bigness and elemental beauty, he credits it with crime-stopping powers: in particular, he says, it will stanch the flow of drugs that feed our country’s raging opioid habit. In his prime-time address to the nation, on January 8th, Trump told Americans that “our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.” Without a wall, he tweeted on January 11th, “Criminals, Gangs, Human Traffickers, Drugs & so much other big trouble can easily pour in. It can be stopped cold!” \n\nOne of the proceedings was the case that the Massachusetts attorney general filed against Purdue Pharma, the company that produced the powerful opioid painkiller OxyContin, along with some of the company’s directors and eight members of the [Sackler family](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-family-that-built-an-empire-of-pain), which owns it. For years, the Sacklers, an art-loving, philanthropic clan, have represented themselves as hands-off proprietors, who were unaware of both the dangers of OxyContin and Purdue’s aggressive marketing of it. (In 2007, Purdue and three current and former top executives, none of them Sacklers, pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges of misleading the public about the addiction risks of OxyContin, and paid $634.5 million in fines.) But a court filing released last week disclosed the exulting of one family member, Richard Sackler, that OxyContin would create “a blizzard of prescriptions,” which he predicted would be “dense, deep and white.” It also contained his recommendation, in an e-mail, “to hammer on abusers in every way possible”—on people, in other words, who had become dependent on a drug that was extremely addictive, and, thanks in large part to Purdue’s assurances that it was not, was wildly overprescribed. The case was a reminder than an opioid epidemic that is largely responsible for lowering life expectancy in the United States for the first time since 1980 began quite legally, with a drug manufactured not by a Mexican cartel but by an American pharmaceutical company.\n\nThe second proceeding was the trial of Joaquín ([El Chapo](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/21/kate-del-castillo-sean-penn-and-el-chapo)\\) Guzmán Loera, the suspected leader of the Sinaloa drug cartel, which has been under way in New York since early November. This week, a former high-ranking associate of Guzmán’s, named Jesús Zambada García, was testifying about the cartel’s business practices. Asked how it typically smuggled drugs into the United States, Garcia explained that Mexican drug traffickers rely mainly on vehicles driven through official border checkpoints. They used illicit tunnels under the border in the early nineteen-nineties, he explained, but, after the tunnels were detected and closed, they turned to hiding narcotics in legitimate-looking shipments of canned goods and the like. Sometimes they transported them by sea, smuggling drugs in fishing boats or dispatching them in submersibles. One stratagem they did not apparently resort to was sneaking across the Mexican border *between* checkpoints—the gaps that a wall would fill. \n\nThis testimony comported with what Daniel Ciccarone, a researcher who heads the [Heroin in Transition project](https://globalprojects.ucsf.edu/project/heroin-transition) at the University of California, San Francisco, had told me. If you’re going to put money into drug interdiction—an endless task, he said, given how nimble and persistent the cartels are in responding to demand—“Where are you going to get the most bang for your buck? Is it going to be stopping a person hiking through the desert to get to Texas? Or is it going to be stopping trucks?” He answered his own question: “The tonnage is coming in through trucks and cars that go through border checkpoints—so put the money there.” (The compromise bill on border security that the Democratic-led House passed on January 3rd does just that, allotting additional funds to “non-intrusive inspection devices” at ports of entry.)\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Agency’s [2018 National Drug Threat Assessment](https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2018-11/DIR-032-18%202018%20NDTA%20final%20low%20resolution.pdf) underlines the point: the majority of the heroin that gets across the southwest border, which is indeed where most heroin enters the United States, comes in privately owned cars, trucks, and tractor-trailers “entering the United States at legal ports of entry.” (Cocaine predominantly arrives in vehicles at official points of entry as well, according to the D.E.A, though commercial air travel is another route.) \n\nThe opioid epidemic appeared in three waves, starting in the nineteen-nineties: the first was of prescription pills, mainly OxyContin; the second was of heroin, which replaced pills for some opioid-addicted people, once new prescribing practices and less abusable formulations rendered pills less available; and the most recent took the form of fentanyl and other synthetics, which are cheaper to produce than heroin and fifty times more potent. Ciccarone and his U.C.S.F. colleague Sarah Mars have conducted research showing that the fentanyl wave is a product more of supply than of demand. Most users don’t particularly want fentanyl—they know the risks of overdosing on a much stronger drug—but it’s what’s available now. And it is often branded and sold in powder form as heroin, or formed into counterfeit pills, making it difficult for users and even street-level sellers to know what they’ve got.\n\nFentanyl is used for medical purposes, such as pain relief in cancer and epidurals in childbirth, and is manufactured above-board in this country, where it is a classified as a controlled substance. But illicit fentanyl, which is now at the leading edge of overdose deaths in the United States, has a much more complicated provenance. According to the D.E.A., most of it is made in clandestine laboratories in China. Though some is then smuggled in across the southwest border, much of it is mailed or shipped. Last June, at the port of Philadelphia, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents seized a hundred and ten pounds of fentanyl that was concealed in a shipment of iron oxide from China. (Alerted by a narcotic-sniffing dog, the agents tested the substance with a handheld isotype-analysis tool.) Paul Knierim, the D.E.A.’s deputy chief of operations for the office of global enforcement, testified last September, at a congressional subcommittee hearing titled “[Tackling Fentanyl: The China Connection](https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2018-09/DEA%20Testimony%20-%20China%20and%20Fentanyl%20HFAC_0.pdf),” that “China is one of the world’s top producers of the precursor chemicals used to manufacture methamphetamine and fentanyl.” When the D.E.A. takes action to ban the import of certain chemicals, “Clandestine chemists can easily continue developing and synthesizing new synthetic opioids that do not appear on any schedule of controlled substances,” Knierim said, sometimes in a matter of weeks. “Sadly, these substances are often first discovered when D.E.A. receives reports from local hospitals and coroners in connection with a spate of overdoses.” He added that, because of its potency, “one kilogram of fentanyl purchased in China” carries the potential of “being lethal for five hundred thousand people.”\n\nThe fact that only small amounts of fentanyl are needed to supply a very large population makes detecting and disrupting imports that much harder, Mars told me. This is even more the case with fentanyl substitutes such as carfentanil, a synthetic opioid that is a hundred times more powerful (it’s used as a tranquilizer for elephants and horses) that has begun to turn up in the U.S. heroin supply over the past few years.\n\nFentanyl is also increasingly sold on the dark Web, using cryptocurrency. In August, a joint investigation by the D.E.A., the Department of Justice, the F.B.I., *ICE*{:.small}, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, called Operation Darkness Falls, led to the arrest of a San Antonio couple, Matthew and Holly Roberts, who allegedly ran dark-Web marketplaces for fentanyl and other drugs. The San Antonio *Express-News* [described them](https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/An-ordinary-couple-who-drove-raggedy-cars-13197479.php) as “an ordinary couple” who taught themselves how to conduct their drug trafficking online, disguising it behind a mail-order business for glow bracelets. (They later pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and other crimes.)\n\nIn some ways, the Robertses’ D.I.Y. entrepreneurship and alertness to market trends are very much of our time. The conditions of modern capitalism (from the free and constant flow of goods across borders to the advent of Bitcoin) and the iron law of prohibition (once a drug is banned, another one or another means of procuring it will fill the void) are very good for drug trafficking. Smart interdiction of drugs can make a difference, but you have to be thinking about what will replace the drug whose supply you are cutting off, and whether it might be worse. And, in any case, a wall isn’t smart interdiction.\n\nIn the end, it’s an old story: you can’t really stop drugs unless you stop people from using drugs. In the case of the opioid epidemic, we need greater availability of, less squeamishness about, and more funding for medication-assisted treatments, such as buprenorphine, naltrexone, and methadone. And we need better mental-health care for people who are self-medicating their emotional pain with opioids. Ciccarone told me, “I meet police chiefs who have the right hearts and the right brains. They come in and say, ‘I need to address childhood trauma and other root causes if I want to address drugs and crime.’ They have a long view, and that’s what we need. We should be making a more resilient society—treating the pathos that the drugs are a response to. After twenty years of doing drugs research, I still believe that’s possible.” If only we had a President who agreed with him.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ea32396212cbb9fcb7a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Opioid Crisis","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"opioid-crisis"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c7a41c92e2c9b85da19","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Border Wall","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"border-wall"},{"id":"5c2e2c64aef5062c9d94ad3a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Joaquín Guzmán Loera (El Chapo)","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"joaquin-guzman-loera-el-chapo"},{"id":"5c2e1ca7397f5b30646d0628","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Purdue Pharma","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"purdue-pharma"},{"id":"5c2e1dcfb75f002c8941e5d9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration Law","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration-law"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a033f2179605b11ad996f","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Margaret Talbot joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2003.\nPreviously, she was a contributing writer at the New York *Times\nMagazine* and, from 1995 to 1999, an editor at *The New Republic.* Her\nstories, covering legal issues, social policy, and popular culture, have\nappeared, in addition to in the *Times Magazine* and *The New\nRepublic,* in *The Atlantic Monthly, National Geographic,* and\nthe *Times Book Review*.

The rich guy might decide he can ride out a stolen dick pic or two, especially if he’s already announced that he’s getting divorced. \n\n“Something unusual happened to me yesterday,” [Jeff Bezos](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jeff-bezos), the founder and C.E.O. of Amazon, writes in a [piece](https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f) that appeared on Medium on Thursday evening. “I was made an offer I couldn’t refuse. Or at least that’s what the top people at the National Enquirer thought.” Evidently, Bezos thought different. “Any personal embarrassment AMI could cause me takes a back seat because there’s a much more important matter involved here,” he writes, referring to American Media, Inc., which is the *National Enquirer’s* parent company. “If in my position I can’t stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?\"\n\nAt some length, his article relates the recent dealings that his representatives have had with the *National Enquirer*, which in early January published intimate text messages that he had exchanged with his girlfriend, Lauren Sánchez, a former television anchor. Bezos also published three threatening e-mails sent, on Wednesday, by the supermarket tabloid’s top editor, Dylan Howard, and by Jon Fine, the deputy general counsel of A.M.I.\n\nIn Howard’s e-mail, he describes in graphic terms some of the “photos obtained during our newsgathering,” which he says include “a below the belt selfie” and a shot of “Ms. Sanchez wearing a plunging red neckline dress revealing her cleavage and a glimpse of her nether region.” He concludes, “It would give no editor pleasure to send this email. I hope common sense can prevail — and quickly.” One of Fine’s e-mails lays out the *National Enquirer’s* “proposed terms” for reaching an agreement between the two sides, which included Bezos publicly acknowledging that he and his representatives didn’t have any basis for their suggestion that the original story about him was politically motivated. In a [statement](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/american-media-llc-response-to-statement-by-jeff-bezos-300792328.html) released on Friday morning, the company said, “American Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;. Nonetheless, in light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr. Bezos, the Board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims.”\n\nAll credit to Bezos for refusing to submit to these intimidation tactics. He’s a ruthless plutocrat whose online behemoth crushes retailers big and small. He has run his company with all the transparency of the Politburo. And he has exploited his great riches to buy one of the most important and influential newspapers in the country, the Washington *Post*. But he’s just as entitled as the next person to a private life—and he has just performed an important public service, or maybe two.\n\nBezos has made transparent the bullying tactics employed by the *National Enquirer* and raised the question of how often they are directed at targets who are less well able to defend themselves. “On that point, numerous people have contacted our investigation team about their similar experiences with AMI, and how they needed to capitulate because, for example, their livelihoods were at stake,” Bezos writes. In addition, he has raised the intriguing question of how and why the tabloid went after him in the first place. \n\n“Simply put, this was and is a news story,” Fine, the A.M.I. attorney, says in one of the e-mails. But there are grounds for wondering whether that was really all there was to it. As practically everybody now knows, [David Pecker,](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/david-pecker) the chief executive of A.M.I., is an old friend of [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump). Late last year, A.M.I. entered a [plea agreement](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/nyregion/trump-american-media-michael-cohen.html) with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, in which the company admitted that, in 2016, it bought and suppressed the story of Karen McDougal, an ex-*Playboy* model who claimed to have had an affair with Trump, “so as to prevent it from influencing the election.” At first glance, the Bezos story doesn’t seem to have anything to do with Trump, but first glances can sometimes be deceiving.\n\nOn January 9th, two days after the *National Enquirer* informed him it had obtained intimate text messages he had exchanged with Sánchez, Bezos announced that he and his wife of twenty-five years, MacKenzie, were divorcing. After the *National Enquirer* published some of the texts, Bezos writes, “I engaged investigators to learn how those texts were obtained, and to determine the motives for the many unusual actions taken by the Enquirer.” The principal investigator he hired was Gavin de Becker, a well-known security expert who runs his own consulting firm. “I asked him to prioritize protecting my time since I have other things I prefer to work on and to proceed with whatever budget he needed to pursue the facts in this matter,” Bezos adds.\n\n*  *Read reporting by [Jeffrey Toobin on David Pecker, the chief executive of American Media, Inc., and his fervor for Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/03/the-national-enquirers-fervor-for-trump), and [Ronan Farrow on how the National Enquirer protected Trump early in his Presidential campaign](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-national-enquirer-a-donald-trump-rumor-and-another-secret-payment-to-buy-silence-dino-sajudin-david-pecker).*  *\n\nAccording to a Washington *Post* story that was [published](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/was-tabloid-expose-of-bezos-affair-just-juicy-gossip-or-a-political-hit-job/2019/02/05/03d2f716-2633-11e9-90cd-dedb0c92dc17_story.html?utm_term=.96b4814683b8) on Tuesday,  de Becker and his team “concluded that the billionaire was not hacked. Rather, de Becker said in an interview, the Enquirer’s scoop&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;began with a ‘politically motivated’ leak meant to embarrass the owner of The Post—an effort potentially involving several important figures in Trump’s 2016 campaign.” More specifically, de Becker came to focus his attention on Sánchez’s brother, Michael, a Hollywood talent agent who has ties to Roger Stone and Carter Page, two Trump associates who have been caught up in the Russia investigation. “Michael Sanchez has been among the people we’ve been speaking with and looking at,” de Becker [told](https://www.thedailybeast.com/bezos-investigators-question-the-brother-of-his-mistress-lauren-sanchez-in-national-enquirer-leak-probe) the Daily Beast. \n\nMichael Sánchez is vigorously denying any involvement. In e-mails and texts that the *Post* obtained, he made the extraordinary claim to de Becker that he suspected the texts between Bezos and his sister may have been obtained by the National Security Agency, British intelligence, or the Mossad. The *Post* also reported that Michael Sánchez issued a statement in which he “said he believed de Becker, Bezos’s security chief for two decades, was involved in the leaks to the Enquirer ’to sabotage Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sanchez’s love affair.’&thinsp;”\n\nJust how the *National Enquirer* obtained the photographs remains murky. What’s far clearer is that the publication tried to go gangster on the wrong person. “Of course I don’t want personal photos published, but I also won’t participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks and corruption,” Bezos writes. “I prefer to stand up, roll this log over and see what crawls out.” He won’t be the only one watching.

Pecker is the longtime chief executive of American Media, Inc., which owns most of the nation’s supermarket tabloids and gossip magazines, including the _Star_, the _Globe_, the _Examiner_, and _OK!_, as well as the flagship _Enquirer_. Pecker’s tabloids have few subscribers and minimal advertising. Virtually all their revenue comes from impulse purchases at the checkout counter. A successful _Enquirer_ cover can drive sales fifteen per cent above the weekly average of three hundred and twenty-five thousand copies, and a lemon can hurt sales just as badly, so the choice of cover headlines and photographs represents a nearly existential challenge every week.\n\n\n\n\n\nPecker started in the media business as an accountant, and he has attempted to impose a numbers-based rigor on the raucous world of tabloids. In the past decade, he has devised a proprietary database of the covers of all celebrity magazines, including those of his competitors. The “cover explorer,” as it’s known internally, tells A.M.I. executives how each cover sold in comparison with the magazine’s four- and thirteen-week averages. The explorer is indexed by celebrities and, uniquely, by words in the headlines. Pecker knows with some precision which stars sell (Kelly Ripa, Jennifer Aniston, Brad and Angelina, and, for the older generation, Dolly Parton and the Kennedys), and which phrases draw readers (headlines with the words “sad last days” and “six months to live”).\n\n\n\nTo open a recent meeting, Pecker, who was calling in on speakerphone from Dallas, asked Dylan Howard, A.M.I.’s chief content officer, to review the competition’s covers from the previous week. Howard, an ebullient Australian, is thirty-five, and something of a tabloid prodigy. He made his name with a three-year quest to prove that the actor Charlie Sheen had contracted H.I.V. (which Sheen ultimately acknowledged), and now supervises celebrity coverage for Pecker’s empire. Shuffling through a stack of magazines in front of him, Howard pulled out _Life & Style_, which is owned by Bauer, a German conglomerate. The issue featured Jennifer Lopez on the cover, with a headline claiming that she was expecting a child with her boyfriend, Alex Rodriguez. “*Her ‘miracle’ baby at 47*{: .small}!” the cover announced. Howard dismissed the story. “She’s forty-seven,” he said. “Of course she’s not pregnant.” But there was another reason for Howard’s disdain. “J. Lo doesn’t sell,” he said.\n\n\n\nFor the forthcoming issue of the _Enquirer_, Howard presented a mockup of a cover on Megyn Kelly, who would be making her début as an NBC News correspondent the week that the issue went on sale. The headline read “*What she’s hiding*{: .small}!,” which Pecker praised because the phrase had worked well on another coverline, “*What Hillary’s Hiding*{: .small}!,” during the Presidential campaign. Bullet points under the Kelly headline promised revelations about plastic surgery and a “criminal past.”\n\n\n\nPecker believes in constant market research, so the _Enquirer_ conducts a rolling telephone poll in which it tests cover-story ideas, summarized in a sentence or two, on readers. Howard felt optimistic about the Kelly cover, because seventy-three per cent of respondents said that they would be interested in the story. “She got over seventy per cent, even without the benefit of seeing the cover image,” Howard said, referring to a high-school-yearbook photograph of Kelly with an eighties-style perm, which he felt would attract buyers.\n\n\n\nFor the “skyboxes,” the block headlines above the cover logo, Howard proposed an unflattering recent photograph of the actress Eva Longoria, which had tested at sixty-eight per cent, under the headline “*Packs on 40 pounds*{: .small}!” Howard explained, “We did ask the rep if she’s pregnant. Unfortunately for her, that just seems to be a burrito belly.” A photo in the other skybox was of Pamela Anderson, also in an unbecoming shot, who was, according to the headline, “*Destroyed by Plastic Surgery*{: .small}!” \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/594d5e5ed1d4663a811533aa]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nPecker called on Cameron Stracher, the _Enquirer’s_ lawyer, to see if he anticipated any legal problems with the Kelly story. “We know she got the ‘comment call,’ ” Stracher said. At the _Enquirer_, these offers for comment on critical articles are routinely made to subjects and just as often declined. “It’s factually accurate,” Stracher continued. “She did have this surgery, she does have a criminal past, and the other stuff is opinion, really.” (In a recent memoir, Kelly acknowledged shoplifting, once, when she was twelve. So she was not “hiding” much at all.)\n\n\n\nAs the meeting wound down, the discussion turned to the following week’s issue. Someone suggested a story about a video from Donald and Melania Trump’s first overseas trip. The video, which had just gone viral, showed the couple walking down a red carpet on the airport tarmac in Israel. When Donald reached for Melania’s hand, she slapped it away with a sharp flick of her wrist.\n\n\n\n“I didn’t see that,” Pecker said, on the speakerphone.\n\n\n\nThe half-dozen or so men in the room exchanged looks. One then noted that the footage of Melania’s slap had received a good deal of attention.\n\n\n\n“I didn’t see that,” Pecker repeated, and the subject was dropped.\n\n\n\nIt was a telling moment. Even if the leader of a celebrity-news empire had missed the viral video from the President’s trip, Pecker’s decision to ignore the awkward moment for the First Family was not surprising. The _Enquirer_ is defined by its predatory spirit—its dedication to revealing that celebrities, far from leading ideal lives, endure the same plagues of disease, weight gain, and family dysfunction that afflict everyone else. For much of the tabloid’s history, it has specialized in investigations into the foibles of public personalities, including politicians. In 1987, the _Enquirer_ published a photograph of Senator Gary Hart with his mistress Donna Rice, in front of a boat called the Monkey Business, which doomed Hart’s Presidential candidacy. Two decades later, the magazine broke the news that John Edwards had fathered a child out of wedlock during his Presidential race. When Donald Trump decided to run for President, some people at the _Enquirer_ assumed that the magazine would apply the same scrutiny to the candidate’s colorful personal history. “We used to go after newsmakers no matter what side they were on,” a former _Enquirer_ staffer told me. “And Trump is a guy who is running for President with a closet full of baggage. He’s the ultimate target-rich environment. The _Enquirer_ had a golden opportunity, and they completely looked the other way.”\n\n\n\nThroughout the 2016 Presidential race, the _Enquirer_ embraced Trump with sycophantic fervor. The magazine made its first political endorsement ever, of Trump, last spring. Cover headlines promised, “*Donald Trump’s Revenge on Hillary & Her Puppets*{: .small}” and “*Top Secret Plan Inside: How Trump Will Win Debate*{: .small}!” The publication trashed Trump’s rivals, running a dubious cover story on Ted Cruz that described him as a philanderer and another highly questionable piece that linked Cruz’s father to the assassination of John F. Kennedy.\n\n\n\nIt was even tougher on Hillary Clinton, regularly printing such headlines as “ *‘Sociopath’ Hillary Clinton’s Secret Psych Files Exposed*{: .small}!” A 2015 piece began, “Failing health and a deadly thirst for power are driving Hillary Clinton to an early grave, The _National Enquirer_ has learned in a bombshell investigation. The desperate and deteriorating 67-year-old won’t make it to the White House—because she’ll be dead in six months.” On election eve, the _Enquirer_ offered a special nine-page investigation under the headline “*Hillary: Corrupt*{: .small}! *Racist*{: .small}! *Criminal*{: .small}!” This blatantly skewed coverage continued after Trump took office. Post-election cover stories included “*Trump Takes Charge*{: .small}! *Success in just 36 days*{: .small}!” and “*Proof Obama Wiretapped Trump*{: .small}! *Lies, leaks & Illegal Bugging.*{: .small}” \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/594d5e5d2b807c41693f8f9c]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nPecker and Trump have been friends for decades—their professional and personal lives have intersected in myriad ways—and Pecker acknowledges that his tabloids’ coverage of Trump has a personal dimension. All Presidents seek to influence the media, but Trump enjoys unusual advantages in this regard. He is also in close contact with Rupert Murdoch, whose empire includes Fox News and the _Wall Street Journal_. (While the _Times_ and the Washington _Post_ have produced repeated scoops about Trump and Russia, the _Journal_, which employs a large investigative staff, has largely been silent on the issue.) Unlike Murdoch, Pecker heads a fading and vaguely comic archetype of Americana; sales of the _Enquirer_ are down ninety per cent from their peak in 1970. But the impact of the tabloids, particularly their covers, remains substantial. A.M.I. claims that a hundred million people see the _Enquirer_ in more than two hundred thousand checkout lines around the country every week. And the _Enquirer’s_ covers invariably include statements about celebrities that are deeply misleading, if libel-law-compliant, as well as claims about politicians that are outright lies.\n\n\n\nPecker is now considering expanding his business: he may bid to take over the financially strapped magazines of Time, Inc., which include _Time_, _People_, and _Fortune_. Based on his stewardship of his own publications, Pecker would almost certainly direct those magazines, and the journalists who work for them, to advance the interests of the President and to damage those of his opponents—which makes the story of the _Enquirer_ and its chief executive a little more important and a little less funny.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nI asked Pecker about Trump during our first lunch, at one of the posh Upper East Side restaurants that Pecker frequents. His fondness for long, wine-filled lunches is only one of the ways in which he resembles the media moguls of a bygone age. At a hale sixty-five, Pecker looks as though he could be heading out for a night at the disco. He sports the same kind of bushy mustache as the seventies porn star and period icon Harry Reems. Pecker combs his luxuriant hair straight back over the collars of his monogrammed shirts. He collects sports cars and high-end wristwatches. Still, he feels that the key to the success of the _Enquirer_ is his engagement with his down-market readers.\n\n\n\n\n\nPecker said that the _Enquirer’s_ support of Trump is a straightforward response to its audience. Since January, 2016, _Enquirer_ issues with Trump as the main image have sold between two and fifteen per cent more than the weekly average for non-Trump covers. “They voted for Trump,” Pecker told me, speaking of his readers. “And ninety-six per cent want him reëlected today. That’s the correlation. These are white working people, who love to see takedowns of celebrities, and they want to see—which is unusual, who would think these people would love a billionaire?—the billionaire’s pulpit. They know him from fourteen seasons on ‘The Apprentice’ as the boss, and they loved it when he fired those people and ridiculed them.” Pecker conveyed this admiration to Trump directly: “I’d tell him every time I’d see him. I’d say, ‘Who cares about governor or mayor, you should be President. They love you. These people love you.’ ”\n\n\n\nPecker is eager to use his media empire to help his friends, especially Trump, and unabashedly boasts about doing so. Earlier this year, he bought _US Weekly_, the glossy celebrity magazine, from Wenner Media. (Last week, A.M.I. also bought _Men’s Journal_ from Wenner.) He negotiated the sale primarily with twenty-six-year-old Gus Wenner, the heir apparent of the company, which was co-founded by his father, Jann. “After my first lunch with David, I called up my brother and said, ‘This guy belongs in the Smithsonian,’ ” Gus Wenner told me. “He is the type of character you just don’t come across anymore. The way he operates, the way he does business—it’s completely honorable, but it feels of another era.” The lunch took place at Le Bernardin, one of New York’s temples of haute cuisine, where Pecker is a favorite customer. “When I get there, he’s drinking champagne, and our deal isn’t even done yet,” Wenner said. “And then Éric Ripert, the chef, comes to our table, and he tells us he is working on a TV project. David says to him, ‘We should talk. I could get you some ink.’ It was all very transactional.”\n\n\n\nWenner was curious to hear about Pecker’s relationship with the President. “I thought I would have to pull it out of him smoothly,” he said. “But he offered it up pretty readily, and I was all ears. He was painting Donald as extremely loyal to him, and he had no issue being loyal in return. He told me very bluntly that he had killed all sorts of stories for Trump. He hired a girl to be a columnist when she threatened to go public with a story about Donald.” \n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: /photos/594d5e5eff36f87032dc1989]|||\n\nThe readers of the National Enquirer love stories about celebrities plagued by disease, weight gain, and family dysfunction. “These are people that live their life failing,” Pecker said. “So they want to read negative things about people who have gone up and then come down.” *Photograph by Mark Peterson / Redux for The New Yorker*{: .credit}\n\n|||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nPecker denies telling Wenner that he killed stories for Trump or that he hired a columnist in order to suppress a story about Trump. Nevertheless, last year the _Wall Street Journal_ [reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/national-enquirer-shielded-donald-trump-from-playboy-models-affair-allegation-1478309380) that Pecker paid a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to a woman named Karen McDougal, who had alleged that she had a months-long romantic relationship with Trump, beginning in 2006, during his marriage to Melania.\n\n\n\nWhen I asked Pecker about McDougal, who was _Playboy’s_ Playmate of the Year in 1998, he told me that he first met her when she modelled for the cover of _Men’s Fitness_, another A.M.I. magazine. “When her people contacted me that she had a story on Trump, everybody was contacting her,” he said. “At the same time, she was launching her own beauty-and-fragrance line, and I said that I’d be very interested in having her in one of my magazines, now that she’s so famous.” But Pecker had a condition for hiring her: “Once she’s part of the company, then on the outside she can’t be bashing Trump and American Media.”\n\n\n\nI pointed out that bashing Trump was not the same as bashing American Media.\n\n\n\n“To me it is,” Pecker replied. “The guy’s a personal friend of mine.”\n\n\n\nI e-mailed McDougal, who declined to discuss the matter, writing, “I don’t really like to talk about things other than my interests and passions—and that’s health, wellness, etc, etc!!”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThere are still traces of David Pecker’s Bronx boyhood in his accent and his attitude. He grew up on a Jewish block in a mostly Italian neighborhood until the family moved to New Rochelle, in Westchester County. His parents were older and unwell. His father, a bricklayer, died in 1967, when David was sixteen, and David needed to work to support his mother. He started bookkeeping for local businesses, including some of the rougher-edged outfits from his old neighborhood in the Bronx. By the end of his college days, at Pace University, he was making about two thousand dollars a month, a substantial sum in the late nineteen-sixties. One of his clients was an excavating contractor who couldn’t get a license to buy explosives, because he had a criminal record. “I was the one who was able to get the license, and I received the Dynomax in the Bronx,” Pecker told me.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter passing the C.P.A. exam, Pecker went to work as an accountant for CBS, which during the seventies had a magazine division that included _Car & Driver_, _Road & Track_, _Field & Stream_, and _Modern Bride_. He moved up the ranks at CBS but chafed against the bureaucratic culture. “You could not go to the bathroom there without getting permission from somebody first,” he told me. “You couldn’t give your secretary a dollar raise, you couldn’t do anything.”\n\n\n\nIn 1987, Pecker made a deal with an entrepreneur named Peter Diamandis to buy out CBS’s magazines, some of which they sold to Hachette, a French conglomerate that owned such magazines as _Paris Match_ and _Elle_, and also manufactured fighter planes. At Hachette, Pecker set out to learn about the sales, marketing, and manufacturing sides of the magazine business. Notably, he never worked as a journalist, an omission that has led him to disdain certain conventions. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/594d5e5d2b807c41693f8f9b]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nIn 1990, Pecker was named the president of Hachette, which later bought _Premiere_, a movie magazine, with the financier Ronald Perelman. In 1996, after Perelman questioned a _Premiere_ investigation about financial problems at Planet Hollywood, a company to which Perelman had business ties, Pecker killed the story. “The last time I looked, I am the C.E.O. of this company,” Pecker told a reporter. When I asked him about the contretemps, Pecker explained it as a financial decision. “I called the editor up and I said, ‘Why are we doing an investigative piece on Planet Hollywood, when this is supposed to be a film magazine?’ ” He told the editor that he had spent two hundred thousand dollars on a research study showing that every time the magazine did an investigative piece sales went down. “I said, ‘I don’t really feel that this is appropriate.’ So he calls a news conference, resigns, and the whole staff is upset.” The actor Kevin Costner even joined in the protest, refusing to appear on the cover of the magazine. Pecker said that he told Costner, “It’s a coveted thing to be on the cover of _Premiere_ magazine. John Travolta took it in a second.”\n\n\n\nPecker quickly earned a reputation for producing magazines more cheaply than his competitors could. He also invested in new projects, including _George_, a political magazine founded, in 1995, by John F. Kennedy, Jr. “Hachette seemed like a different kind of place than some of the other publishing companies,” Michael Berman, Kennedy’s partner on _George_ and now the head of the investment firm Galaxy Partners, told me. “It was a little grittier than most, a little more bottom-line-oriented at the time. Not a lot of bells and whistles. Since we were going to be owners as well as implementing it, we liked that there was attention to the bottom line.” _George_ got off to a fast start but ultimately foundered after Kennedy’s death, in a plane crash, in 1999.\n\n\n\nPecker has no strong political views, but he has a fascination with, and a reverence for, celebrity. Recalling his first meeting with Kennedy, Pecker told me, “It was February, he comes up on his bike, he’s outside, he has his hat over his head, he comes inside, he takes off his coat, he has a beautiful Armani suit on, and he pulled his cap off and it was like he never even had to comb his hair! I don’t understand it. I mean, every hair was perfect. Every hair was perfect!” Pecker met Trump around the time he launched _George_, and his relationship with the developer resembled his connection to Kennedy. Talking about an early visit to Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s estate in Palm Beach, where he was pitching advertisers on _George_, Pecker described Trump’s then wife, Marla Maples: “I have never in my entire life seen a more beautiful woman in a bodysuit than Marla Maples. I mean, seriously, out of ten she was a fifteen.” For Pecker, Trump represented an aspirational figure in every dimension of life: in his glamour, his wealth, his access to beautiful women, and his style of living.\n\n\n\nPecker created a custom-publishing division at Hachette, producing magazines for clients who would dictate the content and then distribute them to customers. The first, _Sony Style_, was made for the electronics company. Pecker’s next idea was for a magazine about Donald Trump. Pecker had a home in Palm Beach, not far from Mar-a-Lago, and a neighbor there introduced him to Trump, who agreed to the project. The result was a magazine called _Trump Style_, which today looks like a glossy preview of the coverage Pecker later gave Trump in his tabloids. Representative samples include “Trump Tower, with its bronze façade and swaths of rose marble, combines New York City’s most glittering destination with shops both popular and posh”; “40 and Fabulous: Donald Trump’s latest real estate venture, a landmark office building at 40 Wall Street, could not be in a better location”; “A weekend at Trump Taj Mahal can’t help but be an exhilarating exercise in glamour and fun.” The magazine came out for five years and was, according to Pecker, “very successful.”\n\n\n\nIn the late nineties, just before the dot-com boom, money managers still regarded print magazines as a market for growth. In early 1999, the private-equity firm Evercore went looking for media opportunities and came upon American Media, Inc. Evercore recruited Pecker both as an investor and as the chief executive of the company, and closed a seven-hundred-and-sixty-seven-million-dollar deal for A.M.I. in March of that year. A.M.I. owned a number of magazines, but its core asset was the _Enquirer_. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/594d5e5eebd5596cf6186365]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe _Enquirer_ has unapologetically paid for interviews and photographs since the days of its founder, Generoso Pope, Jr. Pope’s immigrant father published the highly successful Italian-American newspaper _Il Progresso_, and Pope grew up in luxury. He was driven to school at Horace Mann in a limousine each morning, often accompanied by his friend and classmate Roy Cohn. (Cohn later became an aide to Joseph McCarthy and a mentor to Donald Trump; he represented Trump in the 1973 Justice Department case that accused his company of violating the Fair Housing Act.) According to “[The Godfather of Tabloid](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0049ENHMQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1),” by Jack Vitek, Pope breezed through M.I.T. and did a brief stint in the C.I.A., then in its infancy, before returning, in 1952, to New York, where he struck out on his own, buying a moribund Hearst weekly and rechristening it the _National Enquirer_.\n\n\n\n\n\nPope was a dour and mysterious character, who exerted almost total control over the _Enquirer_ for thirty-six years. The early days, during which he attempted to brand the _Enquirer_ as a serious, upscale weekly, were rocky. As Pope later told the tale, he had an epiphany one day when he found himself gazing at a particularly gruesome traffic accident, and noticed how many other people had also stopped to stare. “It suddenly hit me,” Pope recalled. “That’s what people want to see. That’s what I’ll give them, blood and gore.”\n\n\n\nIn the fifties and sixties, the formula was a resounding success. With headlines like “*Mom Boiled Her Baby and Ate Her*{: .small}” and photographs of purported freaks of nature, such as two-headed babies, circulation soared to more than a million. The _Enquirer_ developed a specialty in photographs of newly dead celebrities, and the paper scored a famous scoop with a photograph of Lee Harvey Oswald on the autopsy table. (Dylan Howard found an original of that cover on eBay and displays it in his office.)\n\n\n\nIn the late sixties, Pope moved his operations to Florida, where he had another insight that transformed the magazine. At that point, the _Enquirer_ was sold only through traditional venders, such as newsstands, but Pope pioneered the practice of putting magazines in supermarket checkout lines. This required him to scale back the gore (which was unacceptable to the markets) and amp up the celebrity coverage. The transformation proved a boon to business. So did a television campaign featuring the catchphrase “Enquiring minds want to know.” A cover photograph, in 1977, of Elvis Presley in his casket sold 6.7 million copies, an all-time record. (According to a former editor, the _Enquirer_ had paid Elvis’s cousin Billy Mann eighteen thousand dollars for the image. In the past, the tabloid has paid anywhere from a few hundred dollars to six figures for scoops.) After Pope started printing the _Enquirer_ in color, he used his old black-and-white presses to produce the _Weekly World News_, a compendium of true lunacy, often featuring space aliens, which was also a financial success, with as many as a million readers.\n\n\n\nPope died in 1988, when the _Enquirer’s_ circulation was about four million, and the company fell into limbo. The _Enquirer_ tabloids were eventually sold to Evercore, as a part of the A.M.I. deal, in 1999, and David Pecker became the C.E.O. Meanwhile, competitors were eating into the _Enquirer’s_ circulation. Rupert Murdoch had started the _Star_, and a Canadian publisher named Mike Rosenbloom had launched a series of look-alike tabloids called the _Globe_, the _Examiner_, and the _Sun_. Pecker quickly took steps to crush the competition. He bought the _Star_ and Rosenbloom’s magazines, and closed the _Weekly World News_. He also relocated the operation to Rosenbloom’s old headquarters, in Boca Raton. Kevin Hyson, Pecker’s longtime deputy at A.M.I., told me, “He renovated the entire building, spent five or six million dollars, and the building was beautiful, and it came out great, and it was virtually all done. The cafeteria was just about to open, when we were attacked.”\n\n\n\nIn late September, 2001, Bob Stevens, a sixty-three-year-old photo editor at the _Sun_, fell ill. On October 2nd, he checked into a local hospital and was later given a diagnosis of inhalation anthrax. On Stevens’s desk, in the A.M.I. building, investigators discovered an envelope containing powdered anthrax and addressed to the “photo editor” of the _Sun_. Stevens died on October 5th, becoming the first anthrax fatality in the United States since 1976. In short order, the Centers for Disease Control closed the _Enquirer_ building, and most of the employees never set foot inside it again. The structure was so contaminated that all of its contents were destroyed in 2003; the _Enquirer’s_ archive, including photographs, back issues, and notes, was lost in the process. \n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: /photos/594d5e5ed1d4663a811533a8]|||\n\nLast year, the Wall Street Journal reported that Karen McDougal, a Playboy Playmate, claimed to have had an affair with Trump during his marriage to Melania. Pecker hired McDougal as a columnist and paid her a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the rights to the story, which he never published. “The guy’s a personal friend of mine,” Pecker said. *Photograph by Mark Peterson / Redux for The New Yorker*{: .credit}\n\n|||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nDuring the outbreak, Pecker offered to bring in a team of doctors to dispense Cipro, an antibiotic, to hundreds of employees at his own expense. (Only one other employee was exposed to anthrax, and he survived.) Pecker also located alternative offices. “He protected his people,” Hyson said. “And we never missed an issue.” As a former _Enquirer_ staffer, who was generally critical of Pecker, told me, “This was his finest hour.” (No arrests were ever made in the 2001 anthrax attacks, which ultimately killed four people in addition to Stevens. Bruce Ivins, a government scientist who was a leading suspect, committed suicide in 2008.)\n\n\n\nBy the time of the anthrax attack, the market for tabloids was shrinking. Competition from the Internet, the decline of print, and the growth of gossip shows on cable television had combined to cut into circulation numbers. Still, there was a core market for Pecker’s products, and he raised prices for his remaining customers. The _Enquirer_ cost a dollar and forty-nine cents when Pecker bought it; the current price is four dollars and ninety-nine cents. He also targeted his tabloids to specific age groups. _OK!_ and _US Weekly_, the newest A.M.I. magazine, have the youngest and most affluent readers, most of whom are in their late thirties and forties and gravitate toward Hollywood gossip. The _Enquirer_ appeals to people in their fifties, who like investigations. The _Globe_ is pitched to buyers in their sixties, who are fascinated by the British Royal Family and loathe Hillary Clinton. According to Pecker, “They love to read the worst possible, horrible things you could read about Hillary.” (A recent _Globe_ headline asserted, “*Hillary: The Real Russian Spy*{: .small}! . . . *New Treason Indictment*{: .small}!”) The oldest audience buys the _Examiner_, whose readers, remarkably, average eighty years old. “They have the lowest income,” Dylan Howard told me. “We do a lot of giveaways for them, and stories about ‘The Golden Girls.’ ” As Pecker said to me, “The people that pay those five dollars, we get a spike the week that they get their Social Security checks. And then they pay us down from there, and then it spikes again. So they actually budget for it.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nPecker and I had lunch in May, just after Tiger Woods was arrested for driving under the influence, and the occasion evoked some wistfulness about the difficulty of publishing a weekly magazine in a world that operates at the pace of the Internet. “That jail photo—we would have had that first,” Pecker told me, referring to Woods’s mug shot. “We would have shown the ‘before’ and ‘after’ on the cover of the _Enquirer_.” Instead, Woods’s booking photo hit the Internet well before the tabloid could run it in the magazine.\n\n\n\n\n\nPecker’s relationship with Woods suggests how he’s leveraged his brands even in a declining market. In 2007, the magazine’s tip line received a call claiming that Woods was having trysts with a waitress named Mindy Lawton, who worked at a diner near his home in Orlando. The tipster was Lawton’s mother. As Pecker recalled, “She said her daughter serves him, and then she has a relationship with Tiger, and she goes out to the parking lot behind there and they have sex together.”\n\n\n\nAfter talking to Lawton’s mother, _Enquirer_ reporters staked out the parking lot by the diner, and they saw Woods and Lawton together. “What happened was, Tiger gets into the S.U.V., she came out of the restaurant,” Pecker told me. “The _Enquirer_ guys were behind the bushes and she must have had her period, so she threw the tampon and they grabbed it.” After the obligatory comment call to Woods, Pecker received a phone call from Mark Steinberg, Woods’s agent.\n\n\n\n_Men’s Fitness_ had asked Woods to appear on its cover several times, but he had always declined. A negotiation ensued, whereby Woods would pose for the magazine’s cover in return for a cancelled story in the _Enquirer_ about the diner tryst. Neal Boulton, the editor of _Men’s Fitness_ at the time, recalled, “Pecker was all over me about the negotiations with Tiger’s people.” Boulton quit before the Woods cover was published. “I allowed myself to get sucked into this situation,” he told me. “I just felt pretty lousy about it all.” (Lawton, Steinberg, and Woods declined to comment; Lawton’s mother could not be reached for comment.) \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/594d5e5d985744755ba41e85]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nPecker didn’t see the negotiation as blackmail. “I was never going to run any of it, because I’d be thrown out of Walmart tomorrow,” he said, referring to the parking-lot encounter’s unsavory details. Twenty-three per cent of the _Enquirer’s_ sales come from Walmart, and the next biggest outlet is the Kroger supermarket chain, at ten per cent; chain stores account for roughly three-quarters of total sales. There are no formal rules for the level of explicitness or vulgarity that the chains will tolerate, but Pecker is careful not to push the limits. In the end, he scored dual victories with Woods: the golfer posed for the cover of _Men’s Fitness_, and later the affair appeared in the skybox of the _Enquirer_. Woods’s marriage and career dissolved not long afterward.\n\n\n\nSteinberg’s attempt to negotiate with the _Enquirer_ was unusual. For celebrities in the tabloid’s gaze, there are often only two options. Marty Singer, a Beverly Hills attorney who represents many subjects of _Enquirer_ stories, told me that the publication will back down in the face of contrary evidence. “You can’t just tell them that a story is wrong,” Singer said. “But, if you present actual evidence that it’s wrong, they usually will respond appropriately.” (Libel suits against the _Enquirer_ are rare these days, though in 2014 the magazine settled a case filed by a friend of Philip Seymour Hoffman, apologizing for a false story in connection with the actor’s death and agreeing to fund an annual playwriting award in his name. Richard Simmons, the fitness guru, recently sued the _Enquirer_ for libel based on stories alleging that he had disappeared from public view because he was transitioning into a woman; the case is pending.)\n\n\n\nThe other approach is a fatalistic withdrawal from the _Enquirer_ ecosystem. “If the story is just in the tabloids, we tend to ignore it,” Jon Liebman, the chief executive of Brillstein Entertainment Partners, a leading talent-management firm in Hollywood, whose clients include Brad Pitt, said. “If you engage in tabloid culture, it will never stop, because the tabloid culture feeds on the conversation. If you respond, they just turn your response into a story. But if the fire jumps the road, and a story gets into the mainstream press, then we deal with it.” Politicians almost never engage.\n\n\n\nFor Pecker, the Tiger Woods story encapsulates the grim ethos of _Enquirer_ readers. “Do they care about Tiger Woods? No,” Pecker said. “Do they play golf? No. But do they want to read about his indiscretions? Yes. Do they want to read that someone who is that successful is now failing? Yes. These are people that live their life failing, so they want to read negative things about people who have gone up and then come down.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAfter Pecker acquired A.M.I., his friendship with Trump deepened. Pecker joined Mar-a-Lago in 2003 and attended Donald’s marriage to Melania there in 2005. When Pecker gave a speech at Pace, his alma mater, Trump introduced him. The _Enquirer_ held its ninetieth-birthday celebration at the Trump SoHo Hotel. Pecker was also invited to a lavish wedding that Trump organized for his ex-wife Ivana, in 2008. “Donald threw this unbelievable party for her at Mar-a-Lago—maybe seven or eight hundred people,” Pecker told me. (Ivana’s marriage, to Rossano Rubicondi, an Italian model and actor more than twenty years her junior, ended in less than a year.) Pecker hired Ivana to write an advice column for the _Globe_, but later replaced her with Debbie Reynolds. When Pecker got to know Jared Kushner, the pair bonded over their interest in the media and considered doing business together. (Jared has owned the New York _Observer_, which was once a weekly, since 2006.)\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump has a great affection for venerable media institutions like the _Enquirer_, according to a longtime associate: “Donald came up in the seventies and eighties, and he still loves the iconic brands, and the _National Enquirer_ was an institution in those days. It reached millions of people. Even though it’s smaller now, Donald’s mind-set is that it’s an influential publication. And he reaches out to those readers when no one else will.” Trump’s personal relationship with Pecker facilitated that outreach. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/594d5e5ed1d4663a811533a9]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nA former _Enquirer_ employee told me that Pecker would frequently fly from New York to Palm Beach and back on Trump’s private plane. “David thought Donald walked on water,” the employee said. “Donald treated David like a little puppy. Donald liked being flattered, and David thought Donald was the king. Both have similar management styles, similar attitudes, starting with absolute superiority over anybody else.” In the eighties and early nineties, Trump was something of a fixture in the _Enquirer_, thanks to his multiple marriages. A typical headline from 1990 read “*Trump’s Mistress Cheats on Donald with Tom Cruise*{: .small}.” But, once Pecker took over, critical coverage of Trump vanished. “They have an agreement where David would not write anything that damages Donald,” a senior A.M.I. official from this period told me.\n\n\n\nOne employee said that Trump was also a frequent source for _Enquirer_ stories. “When there was something going on in New York, David would talk with Trump about it. Trump provided David with stories directly,” the employee said. “And, if Donald didn’t want a story to run, it wouldn’t run. You can put that in stone.” Indeed, early in the 2016 campaign Pecker simply turned over the pages of the _Enquirer_ to Trump, allowing the candidate to write columns under his own byline.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nBecause of Pecker’s close ties with the President, rumors have circulated that the publisher is in line for an ambassadorship. Pecker denies any interest in such a post. Dave Zinczenko, who oversaw several of Pecker’s fitness magazines, told me, “We were having lunch around the time the ambassador story first circulated. He laughed about it. He said that Germany or the U.K. would be too much work. It’s clear he doesn’t want to be an ambassador. It would take him out of the game.” (Pecker said that he would welcome an appointment to the President’s Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition, a part-time, unpaid, and honorary post.)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf anything, Pecker may further entrench himself in the media business. In 2013, just before Time, Inc., separated from its longtime parent company, Time Warner, Trump devoted a telling series of tweets to Pecker. “David Pecker would be a brilliant choice as CEO of *TIME*{: .small} Magazine—nobody could bring it back like David!” Trump wrote. “@*TIME*{: .small} Magazine should definitely pick David Pecker to run things over there—he’d make it exciting and win awards!” Ron Burkle, a California supermarket magnate and a friend of Pecker’s, recalled, “I know they were considering him to be C.E.O. when _Time_ magazine spun off. He hasn’t had a decent balance sheet for as long as I’ve known him, but he figures out how to make his numbers work and keep his businesses going. But the boards of companies like Time Warner can be very political, and they weren’t going to turn the company over to the guy who runs the _Enquirer_.” At the time, it did seem outlandish that the steward of a supermarket-tabloid empire would wind up as the proprietor of a storied name in American journalism. But the idea of Pecker as the leader of Time, Inc., like that of Trump as the President of the United States, has gone from preposterous to more than possible.\n\n\n\nPecker has proved to be a canny leader in a difficult time for print publications. After the recession in 2010, the company reorganized under bankruptcy laws. Evercore sold its original equity stake in 2002, and in the past two decades A.M.I. has had various owners, with a changing cast of board members, but always with Pecker as chief executive. The current board includes David Hughes, who spent many years as a senior executive in Trump’s casino business. At A.M.I. board meetings, which are often held at Mar-a-Lago, Pecker boasts of his relentless cost-cutting at the magazines. (Dylan Howard told me that Pecker reduced editorial expenses by fifty-two per cent over four years, while producing the same number of magazines.) Pecker has a handsome salary, but not one that places him in the top ranks of media entrepreneurs. According to S.E.C. filings, A.M.I. paid Pecker $3.1 million last year. The over-all decline in the marketplace, notwithstanding, Pecker persuaded the board to put up a hundred million dollars to buy _US Weekly_ from Wenner. The _US Weekly_ staff, much reduced by layoffs, now works alongside the tabloid employees in the Manhattan newsroom. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/594d5e5de12ccd77a1625e93]\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nPecker remains interested in running Time, Inc., with its stable of weeklies, including _Time_, _Sports Illustrated_, and the great prize, _People_. For a while, the company was shopping itself to potential buyers, and though it’s not officially on the market, these sorts of auctions generally end, sooner or later, with a sale. A.M.I. faces many of the same financial challenges as Time, Inc., and an adviser to Pecker describes the prospect of a merger between them as “two drunks trying to hold each other up.” But both companies own some of the last weeklies in the country, and a merger would mean efficiencies in printing and distribution. Pecker couldn’t buy Time, Inc., on his own, however. He would need, as with Evercore and A.M.I., a deep-pocketed partner, and he’s looking to find one. “I think that there’s a huge opportunity,” Pecker said.\n\n\n\nAt a time when many print publications have disappeared, the readers and employees of Time, Inc., can expect that Pecker, with his disciplined regimen of cost-cutting, usually in the form of layoffs, would keep the company’s venerable titles alive. But _Time_ and the other magazines would survive, as the _Enquirer_ does, as vehicles for Pecker’s cultivation of his friend, the President. That’s what happened when Pecker bought _US Weekly_, which has heretofore largely been apolitical in its orientation. In one of the early issues of _US Weekly_ under Pecker’s leadership, the magazine ran a fawning cover story about Ivanka Trump. “Balancing her personal ideals with love and loyalty to her father,” the cover said, “the president’s daughter will always fight for what she believes in.” ♦","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/03/the-national-enquirers-fervor-for-trump","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8c2710c62d10815435","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"David Pecker","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"david-pecker"},{"id":"5c2e1cc141e4c73c088d77e1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"National Enquirer","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"national-enquirer"},{"id":"5c2e1e1b81ab3335f580f321","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tabloids","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tabloids"},{"id":"5c2e1c842396212cbb9fc9a8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Journalism","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"journalism"}],"sections":[{"id":"591bafaa64942807b0a6072b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Publishing World","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-publishing-world"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a02be019dfc3494ea4162","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jeffrey Toobin has been a staff writer at _The New Yorker_ since 1993 and the senior legal analyst for CNN since 2002.

A few weeks earlier, Sajudin had signed a contract with A.M.I., agreeing to become a source and to accept thirty thousand dollars for exclusive rights to information he had been told: that [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump), who had launched his Presidential campaign five months earlier, may have fathered a child with a former employee in the late nineteen-eighties. Sajudin declined to comment for this story. However, six current and former A.M.I. employees, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared legal retaliation by the company, said that Sajudin had told A.M.I. the names of the alleged mistress and child. Reporters at A.M.I. had spent weeks investigating the allegations, and Sajudin had passed a lie-detector test, during which he testified that high-level Trump employees, including Trump’s head of security, Matthew Calamari, had told him the story. \n\n*The New Yorker* has uncovered no evidence that Trump fathered the child. A spokesperson for the Trump Organization denied the allegations, including the assertion that Calamari told Sajudin the story. When I reached out to the alleged daughter, she declined through a representative of her employer to answer questions. Her mother did not respond to repeated requests for comment. I spoke with the father of the family, who said that Sajudin’s claim was “completely false and ridiculous” and added that the *Enquirer* had put the family in a difficult situation. “I don’t understand what they had to pay this guy for,” he said. *The New Yorker* is not disclosing the family members’ names, out of respect for their privacy. Regardless of the veracity of Sajudin’s claims, legal experts said that A.M.I.’s payment to Sajudin is significant because it establishes the company’s pattern of buying and burying stories that could be damaging to Trump during the Presidential campaign.\n\nSajudin met the A.M.I. reporter at the McDonald’s that winter night to sign an amendment finalizing the transaction and adding a million-dollar penalty if the ex-doorman were to disclose the information without A.M.I.’s permission. According to a source with knowledge of the meeting, the two of them signed the amendment—an unexecuted copy of which was obtained by *The New Yorker*—and Sajudin remarked that it was going to be “a very merry Christmas.” Shortly after the company paid Sajudin, the chairman and C.E.O. of A.M.I., David Pecker, who has spoken publicly about his friendship with Trump, ordered the A.M.I. reporters to stop investigating, the sources told me. One of the employees involved said, “There’s no question it was done as a favor to continue to protect Trump from these potential secrets. That’s black-and-white.” \n\nA.M.I.’s thirty-thousand-dollar payment to Sajudin appears to be the third instance of Trump associates paying to suppress embarrassing stories about the candidate during the 2016 Presidential race. In August, 2016, A.M.I. paid [Karen McDougal](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-a-playboy-model-and-a-system-for-concealing-infidelity-national-enquirer-karen-mcdougal), a former *Playboy* model, a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for her story about a nine-month affair with Trump, and then never published an article about it. (A.M.I. said her story was not credible.) In October, 2016, Trump’s personal attorney, [Michael Cohen](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/donald-trump-has-good-reason-to-be-rattled-about-the-michael-cohen-raid), paid Stephanie Clifford, an adult-film actress who performs under the name [Stormy Daniels](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/26/what-went-wrong-in-the-stormy-daniels-case), a hundred and thirty thousand dollars to keep her account of an affair with Trump secret. (Clifford’s agreement was distinct from McDougal’s in that it was arranged directly with Cohen. A.M.I. was not party to the contracts between Cohen and Clifford that have been released.) \n\nTwo of the former A.M.I. employees said they believed that Cohen was in close contact with A.M.I. executives while the company’s reporters were looking into Sajudin’s story, as Cohen had been during other investigations related to Trump. “Cohen was kept up to date on a regular basis,” one source said. Contacted by telephone on Wednesday, Cohen said that he was not available to talk. Subsequent efforts to reach him were unsuccessful. On Monday, F.B.I. agents raided Cohen’s hotel and office. The [*Times* reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/us/politics/trump-russia-mueller-rosenstein.html) that the agents were looking for records related to the payments to McDougal and Clifford, as well as correspondence between Cohen, Pecker, and Dylan Howard, A.M.I.’s chief content officer.\n\nThe White House declined to comment. A source close to the White House said that Trump “did not have an affair. This is a totally false accusation. And I’d refer you to A.M.I.” \n\n-=-=-=-\n\nTexts and e-mails from November of 2015 show that, before reporting was halted, the *National Enquirer* team was pursuing leads and trying to confirm Sajudin’s story. Reporters had staked out the homes of the alleged mother and daughter. The company had also hired an outside private investigator named Michael Mancuso, a former criminal investigator and the owner of Searching for the Truth Investigative Services, who administered the lie-detector test. (Mancuso declined a request for comment.) Lie-detector tests are notoriously flawed, and the test assessed only whether Sajudin had heard the story, not whether there was truth to the underlying claim. \n\nSharon Churcher, one of the lead A.M.I. reporters on the story, told me, “I do not believe that story was true. I believed from the beginning it was not true.” Other employees at A.M.I. had questions about Sajudin’s credibility. In 2014, a [Web site](http://www.dinosajudin.com/2014/02/residents-of-trump-tower-beware.html) registered through a service that obscures the identity of the author claimed that Sajudin had made similar accusations against a Trump Tower resident named Lawrence Penn III, and that those accusations were false. (Penn could not be reached for comment. In 2015, he pleaded guilty to securities fraud, and he is currently serving a six-year prison sentence. Penn’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.) When I reached out to Sajudin, he responded, in an e-mail, “My time is valuable. What’s your offer??” After being told that *The New Yorker* does not pay sources, Sajudin declined further requests for an interview. \n\nAlthough many of the A.M.I. sources I spoke with expressed skepticism about Sajudin’s claims, all six agreed that A.M.I. made a concerted effort to shut down the story. Several said that they believed the coverup, rather than the story itself, was of public importance. One told me that, after the polygraph came back positive, “the decision was made at a high level to pay this source those funds and to put this thing to rest without an investigation taking place.” A.M.I.’s decision was unusual even in the context of the company’s other efforts to purchase stories in order to bury them, a practice known as “catch and kill.” Another source, who believed that A.M.I. suppressed the story to help Trump, said of Sajudin, “It’s unheard of to give a guy who calls A.M.I.’s tip line big bucks for information he is passing on secondhand. We didn’t pay thousands of dollars for non-stories, let alone tens of thousands. It was a highly curious and questionable situation.” \n\nA.M.I. later attempted to prevent other outlets from reporting on the story or the company’s payout. In the summer of 2017, the Associated Press began investigating A.M.I.’s suppression of the story. At one point, reporters were hours away from posting a piece, but A.M.I. assembled a legal team to lobby against publication. The team included Lanny Davis, a crisis manager and longtime confidant of Bill and Hillary Clinton who did similar work on behalf of [Harvey Weinstein](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories). Davis and Howard met with a reporter, an editor, and a lawyer from the Associated Press. Citing attorney-client privilege, Davis said that he could not reveal the legal advice he gave Howard, but he described some of what happened in the meeting. Davis told me that Howard presented the A.P. with claims that cast doubt on Sajudin’s character, including the allegations on the anonymous Web site. “When Dylan told me he had these documents and he hoped he would kill the story, my opening statement was, ‘I am not here to kill any story. That’s not what I do for a living,’ ” Davis told me. “I encouraged my client, Mr. Howard, to reveal what he had about the source of the story.” Davis said he told the A.P., “It’s up to you to decide whether to write the story as a ‘he says, he says’ or not.” At the time, the A.P. did not run the story. \n\n\n[#cneembed: script/video/5a0f39d12d1ca05150000005.js?muted=1]||||||\n\n\nOn Wednesday, thirty minutes after *The New Yorker* contacted A.M.I. for comment about the payment to Sajudin, Radar Online, an A.M.I. publication, posted [a story](https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2018/04/donald-trump-love-child-rumor-scandal) acknowledging the thirty-thousand-dollar payment but saying that the former doorman’s story was false. The Radar Online piece quoted Howard saying, “When we realized we would be unable to publish, and other media outlets approached the source about his tale, we released Sajudin from the exclusivity clause that had accompanied his $30,000 payment, freeing him to tell his story to whomever he wanted.” Two A.M.I. employees told me that they’d never seen such a release during their time at the company. A.M.I. has said that Karen McDougal, the former *Playboy* model, has a similar amendment to her contract, but McDougal argues that the company continues to try to prevent her from talking to the press. \n\nEarly Thursday morning, shortly after the Radar Online piece, the A.P. ran [a story](https://www.apnews.com/f37ecfc4710b468db6a103a245146172) describing the payment to Sajudin and the legal obstacles it encountered. “During AP’s reporting, AMI threatened legal action over reporters’ efforts to interview current and former employees and hired the New York law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, which challenged the accuracy of the AP’s reporting,” the story said. \n\n-=-=-=-\n\nOn the surface, it seems surprising that A.M.I. would pay a substantial sum of money for an unverified story. The *National Enquirer’s* circulation numbers suggest that the payouts to Sajudin and McDougal came at a time of declining circulation for the publication. Two A.M.I. sources said they believed that the catch-and-kill operations had cemented a partnership between Pecker and Trump, and that people close to the President had subsequently introduced Pecker to potential sources of funding for A.M.I. One A.M.I. source told me, “Pecker’s not going to take thirty thousand dollars from company funds to shut down a potentially damaging story about his buddy without making sure it got back to him so he could get credit.” In 2017, the company began acquiring new publications, including *Us Weekly* and *Men’s Journal*. According to the *Times*, last July Pecker visited the Oval Office and dined at the White House with a French businessman known for brokering deals with Saudi Arabia. Two months later, the businessman and Pecker met with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. \n\nMcDougal is now suing A.M.I. Her complaint states that she was not aware that A.M.I. consulted with Cohen during her negotiations with the company, as was later reported by the *Times*, and argues that A.M.I. was attempting to “illegally influence the 2016 presidential election.” (A.M.I.’s lawyers, in a response, argued that the company’s actions were protected by the First Amendment and that it was being unfairly penalized for its editorial decision not to run a story.) [Stephanie Clifford is suing Cohen](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/does-stormy-daniels-have-a-case-against-donald-trump) for defamation and for a release from her nondisclosure agreement. Her suit alleges that Cohen’s payment was a violation of campaign-finance law, because it suppressed speech “on a matter of public concern about a candidate for President.” (Cohen has said that Clifford’s story is false and that he made the payment with his own money to protect Trump and his family. Trump has said that he did not know of the payment.) \n\nA nonprofit watchdog organization and a left-leaning political group have filed [formal complaints](https://www.apnews.com/41091faf417445359a85a0e902df4337) requesting that the Justice Department, the Office of Government Ethics, and the Federal Election Commission examine whether the payments to Clifford and McDougal violated federal election law, since Trump did not include them on his financial-disclosure forms. Federal election law bars individuals from making contributions of more than five thousand four hundred dollars to a candidate during an election cycle. \n\nRichard L. Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine, said of the payment to Sajudin, “As with the payment to Stormy Daniels and the McDougal matter, there’s certainly enough smoke here to merit further investigation. However, there are questions of both fact and law that would be relevant before concluding that there’s a likely campaign-finance violation.” One question would be whether the intent was to help the campaign. The timing, months after Trump announced his Presidential candidacy, could be “good circumstantial evidence” of that. Hasen added that the cases involving A.M.I. raised difficult legal questions, because media companies have various exemptions from campaign-finance law. However, he said, “If a corporation that has a press function is being used for non-press purposes to help a candidate win an election, then the press exemption would not apply to that activity.”\n\nStephen Braga, a white-collar-criminal-defense professor at the University of Virginia’s law school, told me that the payment had potential ramifications for ongoing criminal probes of Trump, particularly given the claims of Cohen’s involvement. “Now with this third event it looks more and more like there’s a pattern developing. That may be one of the things that the F.B.I. was trying to find evidence of with the search warrant,” he said. “The pattern seems to be ‘We use third-party intermediaries to pay off individuals with adverse information that may harm the President.’ That is just a shade away from what the special counsel will be looking for in terms of intent on the obstruction-of-justice investigation.” \n\nIn 2011, a federal grand jury in North Carolina [indicted](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/04/us/politics/04edwards.html) the former Democratic Presidential candidate John Edwards for violating campaign-finance laws by “secretly obtaining and using” nearly a million dollars of political donations to conceal his mistress and their baby while he was running for President in the 2008 election. Edwards denied that the payments violated federal election law. A jury acquitted Edwards on one of the charges brought against him and deadlocked on the rest. Federal prosecutors dropped the case, but Edwards never returned to politics. Edwards’s affair, and the existence of his illegitimate child, were first reported by the *National Enquirer*.

There is no other option.”\n\nNow, less than three months later, sixty house Democrats and nine Senate Democrats, including five announced or expected Presidential contenders—Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Bernie Sanders—have backed a resolution outlining the principles and goals of a Green New Deal. Once drafted, the legislation will be the most ambitious climate effort that Congress has ever considered. On Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey, the resolution’s lead sponsors, marked its introduction with a press conference outside the Senate.\n\n“Five decades ago, President Kennedy announced the ambitious goal of sending an American safely to the moon,” Markey said. “He didn’t say how it would be done but that we would do it. We would need a giant rocket made of new metal alloys that had not been invented yet, and it would have to be returned safely to Earth within ten years. He urged us to be bold. I say today that it is time for us to be bold once again.” \n\n“This is a big day for activists all over the country and for frontline communities all over the country,” Ocasio-Cortez said during her turn at the podium. “Today is a big day for people who have been left behind. Today is a big day for workers in Appalachia. Today is a big day for children that have been breathing dirty air in the South Bronx.”\n+++inline-recirc\n+++\n\nThe resolution puts forward the broad goals talked up by Ocasio-Cortez, Markey, and others but avoids some of the fault lines that have emerged between climate activists and moderate Democrats over the past few weeks. Most notably, the resolution does not explicitly call for a ban on fossil fuels, one of the ideas initially put forward by some climate activists. It instead says that the Green New Deal will work toward “meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources”—language that leaves open the possibility of sustaining or expanding nuclear energy, which had been rejected in an open letter last month from over six hundred environmental groups, including the Sunrise Movement. The resolution also does not rule out the possibility of a carbon tax—an idea favored by centrists but viewed as inadequate by many climate activists.\n\nAt the press conference, Ocasio-Cortez referred obliquely to debates over particular provisions. “When people say, what about this or what about that, the answer isn’t, ‘This is why it isn’t in here,’ the answer is, ‘That is part of the solution, too,’ and so I hope you all see that.”\n\nFor Greg Carlock, of the progressive group Data for Progress, which has offered its own Green New Deal outline and has been privy to the talks over the resolution, those debates are secondary to the task of getting members of Congress to take the Green New Deal’s overarching goals seriously. “I think some people will look at this and then tell you all the reasons why, as a legislative agenda, it’s too ambitious or controversial,” he says. “They’ll kind of say, ‘Look at the fossil-fuel ban,’ or look at renewable versus clean and all that kind of stuff. And I see this as a commitment to an effort to meet the scale and urgency of the challenges and define a vision for where we want to drive the country and society. It’s kind of asking Congress to go down on the record.”\n\nOn the specific matter of banning fossil fuels, Julian NoiseCat, of the climate group 350\\.org, says that the language in the resolution meshes with the goal of eliminating fossil fuels without alienating the various progressive stakeholders whom Green New Deal advocates will have to win over. “Any Green New Deal would entail conversation and compromise between the many, many actors across progressive space,” he says, “which would include labor unions that represent fossil-fuel workers—all sorts of different sectors of society. That being said, I think that, given how inclusive they’ve aimed to be in the drafting of this, there was actually some very ambitious language in there about how we are going to transition off of fossil fuel.”\n\nThe Green New Deal has always been far more than a climate plan. There are planks on strengthening antitrust policy, protecting the right of workers to organize, and providing every American with “high-quality health care” and “affordable, safe, and adequate housing.” Perhaps most ambitiously, the resolution calls for a green federal job guarantee—every American, it suggests, will have a job opportunity tied to the project of transitioning America to clean and sustainable energy. All will be paid for primarily, an F.A.Q. offered by Ocasio-Cortez’s team implies, with debt spending. \n\nThe fact that five of the Party’s leading Presidential contenders and sixty Congressional Democrats have signed onto legislation containing these proposals is remarkable. It is an even clearer sign than growing Democratic support for single-payer health care that the era of Clintonian triangulation is over—that the question leading Democrats are asking is not whether the Party should move left but how far left it should go. \n\nThe resolution is also in keeping with the Democratic Party’s longstanding strategy on climate—the Party has long assumed, probably correctly, that major climate action is unlikely unless addressing the crisis is woven securely into the Party’s economic agenda. A job guarantee, as radical as it seems, is an extension of the same logic that led the Obama Administration to tout the creation of green jobs. The resolution also ties climate action to the advancement of a variety of demographic groups, including many clearly important to the Party’s political future. There is much in the text about “frontline and vulnerable communities,” defined as “indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth,” for whom the Green New Deal will also “promote justice and equity by stopping current, preventing future, and repairing historic oppression.”\n\n\n-=-=-=-\nAs the resolution begins moving through both chambers, Representative Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Markey, and other supporters will be drafting the legislation that the Green New Deal outlines. A source close to Senator Bernie Sanders told me on Thursday that he will unveil a Green New Deal bill within the next several months. “Obviously the Green New Deal is an expansive policy,” Stephen O’Hanlon, a spokesperson for the Sunrise Movement, says. “It’s going to need to be multiple bills and long bills, so they’re working on that.” Of course, no bill they propose will be taken up unless Democrats win the White House in 2020, unseating a President who has claimed repeatedly that climate change is a hoax. In 2010, Democrats, who held the Presidency, the House, and the Senate, elected not to advance an ambitious cap-and-trade bill co-authored by Senator Markey, because they failed to secure the sixty Senate votes necessary to break a Republican filibuster. But the majority Party in the Senate can eliminate the filibuster unilaterally, provided it has fifty-one votes for doing so—a tactic  used in recent years to eliminate the filibuster for executive and judicial nominees. At Thursday’s conference, I asked Markey whether, the next time Democrats hold Congress and the Presidency, they should eliminate the Senate filibuster to pass the Green New Deal. “That would be a good problem to have!” he said. “My own feeling is that this is going to be such a powerful issue in the 2020 election cycle that we’re going to have the Republican support, all across the country, to pass it with sixty votes and a supermajority in the House as well.”\n\nThe Trump-era Republican Party, though, will not be budging from climate skepticism any time soon. And, even if Democrats do extraordinarily well in the 2020 Senate elections, it is extremely unlikely that they will win sixty seats. In the best-case scenario for Democrats, the only paths forward for climate legislation are the elimination of the filibuster or, perhaps, the passage of certain tax and spending provisions through budget reconciliation, a maneuver that only requires a simple majority. These are also the only ways to pass other ambitious parts of the Democratic agenda, such as Medicare for All, now nominally supported by all of the Party’s top-tier 2020 Presidential candidates. Denial about this is widespread—no candidate, not even Bernie Sanders, has openly supported eliminating the filibuster. Deploying it would radically transform federal lawmaking and bring American politics to a new, precarious place. It is difficult to imagine Democrats building the will to consider that move easily. It was also difficult to imagine, mere months ago, that the Green New Deal would become the Party’s flagship proposal for climate action. Yet, here we are.

a Sunday in mid-December, some eight hundred young people filled the pews and the aisles of Luther Place Memorial Church in Washington, D.C. They had trickled in from all over the country, in vans and buses, carrying backpacks and sleeping bags, some of them college students and others still in high school. They belonged to an environmental movement called Sunrise, and they had come to the capital to pressure their congressional representatives on the issue of climate change. The next day would be one of visits and protests, where the young people planned to lobby the incoming Democratic majority to begin work on a Green New Deal. The plan they hope to see adopted—to make the United States economy carbon neutral—would be nothing less than a total overhaul of our national infrastructure.\n\nSunrise, founded a year and a half ago by a dozen or so twentysomethings, began its campaign for the Green New Deal last month, when two hundred activists occupied Nancy Pelosi’s office a week after the midterm elections. The movement has allied with the incoming congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who joined them outside Pelosi’s office (and whose run for Congress was inspired, in part, by her participation in the anti-pipeline protests at Standing Rock), and Justice Democrats, the progressive campaign incubator started by former staffers of Bernie Sanders. As the Republican-led government has forced more established environmental organizations into defensive positions, Sunrise has established itself as the dominant influence on the environmental policy of the Democratic Party’s young, progressive wing. \n\nJust as [the March for Our Lives](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/march-for-our-lives) has changed gun-control activism from a movement of grieving parents to one led by students, Sunrise is part of a generational shift in the environmental movement. For years, rhetoric about climate change has invoked the future generations who will have to live with the flooding, storms, droughts, diseases, and food shortages of a warmer world. The young people of Sunrise are telling lawmakers that the future is here: they are the children in question, and the consequences of climate change are affecting them now. And, like other activist movements of their generation, they see their cause as inseparable from the broader issues of economic and social inequality. In a proposal that Ocasio-Cortez has circulated in Congress, she describes the Green New Deal as “a historic opportunity to virtually eliminate poverty in the United States.”\n\nInside Luther Place Memorial Church, cheers erupted as activists unfurled a yellow and black “*GREEN NEW DEAL NOW*{:.small}” banner from the balcony. The crowd hushed as the first speaker, Varshini Prakash, came to the microphone. Prakash, who is five feet tall and has long curly hair, is one of Sunrise’s co-founders. She later told me that a highlight of her activism career was when she participated in a musical disruption of a Trump Administration panel at the United Nations climate conference in Bonn, in 2017, and a story about it trended on Reddit. \n  \n“We’re going to kick things off the way we always do,” Prakash said, “raising our voices in unison in song.” Part of what makes the Sunrise Movement’s activists seem so optimistic is that they conduct most of their protests while singing. Their ranks did not conform to the dour stereotype of an environmental movement composed of white-upper-middle-class Appalachian Mountain Club members. I spoke to Sunrise members whose families had roots in India, Iran, Croatia, Mexico, and working-class neighborhoods in American cities. There were some students in Carhartts and beanies, who looked like they might go camping, but one young person standing near me wore a Sisters sweatshirt, the brand started by the YouTube makeup artist James Charles, who is the first male spokesperson for CoverGirl. Sunrise’s principles include: “We are Americans from all walks of life,” “We are nonviolent in word and deed,” and “We shine bright.” The dominant culture is cheerfulness.\n\nAfter leading the group in a song called “We’re Going to Rise Up,” Prakash introduced herself. She is from a town outside of Boston, but her grandparents are from southern India, and she told the story of a flood that hit their city, Chennai, in late 2015, when the region experienced its highest rainfall in a hundred years. This was typical of Sunrise members, who tend not to talk about starving polar bears, melting ice caps, or ocean acidification. Instead, they talk of family members who have lost their homes to floods or fires, young relatives who have asthma, or beloved landscapes that have been degraded or destroyed in the spans of their short lifetimes. (Another movement principle: “We tell our stories and we honor each other’s stories.”)\n\n“I think no one should have to live in fear of losing the people that they love or the places that they call home due to crises that are preventable,” Prakash told the crowd. “My nightmares are full of starving children and land that is too sick to bear food, of water that poisons that which it should heal, and of seas that are ever more creeping on our shores,” she continued. “But my dreams are also full of a rising tide of people who see the world for what it is, people who see the greed and selfishness of wealthy men, of fossil-fuel billionaires who plunder our earth for profit.” The young people cheered.\n\nMany of Sunrise’s founders met through the fossil-fuel divestment movement, but they tend to cite inspirations from outside environmentalism. Prakash named Occupy Wall Street, the Movement for Black Lives, and youth-led immigration-justice organizations such as United We Dream and Cosecha. Like the March for Our Lives, Sunrise has told a story of a corrupt political process, where oil and gas billionaires like the Koch brothers have helped direct governmental policies. Also like March for Our Lives, Sunrise has focussed on the development of clear, nonpartisan policy goals. Its members are working within existing political structures, pressuring politicians to take more active stances on the issue of climate change and to reject donations from fossil-fuel entities, and getting out the youth vote. \n\n“Our strategy for 2019 is going to be continuing this momentum to build the people power and the political power to make a Green New Deal a political inevitability in America,” Prakash told me. “In 2020, we, along with our partners, are going to be attempting to build the largest youth political force this country has ever seen.” The movement has received support from established environmental organizations, including the Sierra Club and 350\\.org, but a spokesperson for Sunrise, Stephen O’Hanlon, said the assistance has been primarily non-financial. He added that the organization has raised less than a million dollars since it was started, from a mix of grants from foundations and grassroots donors. \n\nStaffers from the Ocasio-Cortez campaign first met with Sunrise at a dinner last summer. Immediately after the November demonstration, Ocasio-Cortez put forward her resolution, drafted in partnership with Sunrise and Justice Democrats, to form a select committee on a Green New Deal in the House of Representatives. \n\nThe resolution calls for a transition to a hundred per cent renewable energy by 2030, the upgrade of residential and industrial buildings to greater energy efficiency, the decarbonization of manufacturing and agriculture, and investment in technology that would reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. If put forward, it would be the most ambitious climate policy the Democratic Party has ever endorsed. For Sunrise, it is the only policy initiative that matches the scope of the crisis.\n\n“We know, from looking at history, that transformation of the scale demanded by science has only happened under two conditions in our history,” one activist told me, at the gathering in the church. “First, when the public has united to address a clear and present threat, and, second, when political leaders have put forward solutions that clearly address that threat and that are clear answers to the crisis.” In its statements, Sunrise makes patriotic appeals to ambitious mobilizations in America’s past, from the Public Works Administration to the moon landing—contrasting a vision of technological innovation and ambition with one of a kleptocratic petro state.\n\nSince Sunrise’s first sit-in, more than forty Democratic representatives have endorsed Ocasio-Cortez’s resolution, including the heads of the progressive caucus, rising stars in the Party like Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, and Joe Kennedy, and veteran activists like John Lewis. But, as Waleed Shahid, the communications director with Justice Democrats, told me, it really only needs the endorsement of one person: the incoming Speaker of the House. So they had come to visit Pelosi once again.\n\nThe next morning, at eight, the activists assembled in the Spirit of Justice Park, outside of Congress. Before occupying the offices of the Democratic leadership, they were going to lobby some fifty Democratic representatives. They took off toward the congressional office buildings singing a song condemning the fossil-fuel economy, whose refrain went, “Which side are you on now? Which side are you on?” \n\nI joined a delegation of about sixty young people who had bussed up from Kentucky as they visited John Yarmuth, the state’s sole Democratic congressperson. Most of them were high schoolers from Louisville and Lexington. They were met at the door by one of Yarmuth’s staffers, who stood and listened while the visitors began their prepared presentation. \n\n“We’re here because we’ve witnessed the failure of political leadership on climate change for as long as we’ve been alive,” a college freshman named Quincy Robinson said, referring to notes on his phone. “The latest United Nations report on climate change gives us just twelve years to rapidly transform society and economies to stop the climate crisis.” \n\nAnother student, Trevor Harry, told a story about canoeing in Beargrass Creek in downtown Louisville, which has been polluted with waste from pig farms. He described some of the legislative goals that the select committee would research, including massive investment in renewable energy, upgrading public transit, and a jobs guarantee with living wages. “It would be the first committee to approach the crisis as the integrated social, scientific, and economic challenge that it is,” Harry said. \n\nThe staffer politely promised to give Yarmuth the message.\n\n The main action of the day took place midmorning, when the protesters split into three groups, to visit the offices of Pelosi, Representative Steny Hoyer, the Democratic Whip from Maryland, and Jim McGovern, the Massachusetts representative who is poised to become the top Democrat on the House Rules Committee. A student from Grand Rapids said she was “fighting for our sacred places.” A student from Wilmington, Delaware, said she was there for “my community, which is already suffering from flooding from sea-level rise. ” A twelve-year-old activist from Denver named Haven Coleman spoke of the poor air quality on the northeast side of her city, where much of the population is Hispanic. “I fear the fires in the summers and the sun that stirs up the local fracking pollution and big car exhaust,” she said. “It leaks into my home, my lungs, sneaking in with the heat, there is no escaping its choke.” More than a hundred of the thousand protesters were arrested for obstructing the hallways while singing songs. \n\nOf the three House leaders, only McGovern appeared in person, stepping out of his office into the hallway. (Pelosi doesn’t use her offices in the Cannon House Office Building, but she works from the Capitol.)\n\n“I’ve met some of you before,” he said, scanning the group. “I’m here to talk about whatever you want.”\n\n“We’re hoping that you will support Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s select committee for a Green New Deal!” someone in the crowd said.\n\n“So the answer is I want to get to yes on that,” McGovern said. “But this is what we’re doing right now—we’re trying to figure out what the committee looks like, and this is a work in progress.”\n\nHe went on to talk about the House Committee on Rules, and jurisdictional issues—that some representatives on the Energy and Commerce Committee are worried their powers are being taken away. (Members of the Natural Resources Committee have also voiced such concerns.)\n\n“I’m working with Leader Pelosi right now to get something in place that’s real, that has money behind it, that’s funded, so there can be a staff, and that’s where we want to get to.” McGovern said. “We’re working on it and I hope that we can get it.”\n\nIt was not the most straightforward endorsement, but the activists took it as a victory nonetheless. In the weeks since the campaign began, Democratic leaders have agreed to revive a select committee on climate change, but have said that it will not be focussed on a Green New Deal, and may not have subpoena power. Speaking this week to the Hill, Hoyer described it as a “recommendatory committee to the Energy and Commerce Committee and the environmental committees.” \n\nIn response to Hoyer’s comment, Prakash said, in a statement, “If true, this decision is an insult to the thousands of young people across the country who have been calling on the Democratic Party leadership to have the courage to stand up to fossil-fuel billionaires and make sure our generation has a livable future.” \n\nCorbin Trent, a spokesperson for Ocasio-Cortez, told me, “What I can say is that I think that if we didn’t already have an interstate highway system in this country I think it would be hard for the Democratic leadership in this country to see a way forward to create one,” he said. “At this moment in time, it seems like shooting for the moon is hard for our leaders to do.”\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\n\t\t\nOn Tuesday morning, the day after the protest in Washington, I met with four of the Sunrise Movement’s co-founders at a bakery near Washington’s Union Station. They had ended the previous day with a small party at the office of 350\\.org. The office of Ayanna Pressley, the newly elected Justice Democrats–endorsed representative from Massachusetts, had sent pizzas.\n\nOver oatmeal and coffee, they told me about their personal awakenings about climate change. Sara Blazevic, who is twenty-five and from New York City, went on a volunteer trip to New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, when she was sixteen. Victoria Fernandez, who is also twenty-five and from California, talked about how unseasonable rains had affected business at the tennis shop her father owns, in the Bay Area. Evan Weber, who is twenty-seven and grew up in Hawaii, told me that the beaches he had played on as a child in Oahu have since been washed away. Stephen O’Hanlon, twenty-three, who is from outside of Philadelphia, had witnessed the effects of mountaintop removal on a trip to Appalachia organized by a college group. \n\nIn late 2015 and early 2016, Prakash and Blazevic, who knew each other from the fossil-fuel divestment campaigns they had led in college, began connecting with other youth climate activists to discuss how they might form a more effective movement. They saw how Bernie Sanders had helped spark a new political energy among their peers, who were suddenly inspired to see their student debt and poor job prospects in more political terms. For Blazevic, the moment of clarity came in December, 2015, when she read remarks from Sanders in which he used the phrase “fossil-fuel billionaires.”\n\n“I remember being, like, ‘That is it, why are we not talking about the fossil-fuel billionaires in the climate movement?” she recalled. “I just remember feeling like this is the story that we should be telling in the climate movement. We should be talking about the people who are most responsible for this crisis, and naming names of the Rex Tillersons of the world instead of doing what the climate movement had been doing for a while, which was, at least, in my corner of it, getting lost in conflicts with college administrators over small pools of money.” \n\nTheir first meeting, in July, 2016, was in the Neighborhood Preservation Center in New York City. They agreed that they wanted to propose solutions to the climate crisis that match its magnitude. Since climate change disproportionately affects poor communities of color, they agreed that racial and economic justice had to be considered in any solution to climate change they proposed. \n\nThey arranged to meet once a month for the next nine months, renting houses or staying with volunteers in a different location each time. They went to an Amish farm in Pennsylvania, to Delaware, to Virginia. Their numbers grew to a dozen people. \t\n\nThey studied the wins and the losses of the climate movement in its forty-year history. They read books about how other mass movements had grown viral and gone to scale—Fernandez fished out a waterlogged copy of the book “[Rules for Revolutionaries](https://www.amazon.com/Rules-Revolutionaries-Organizing-Change-Everything/dp/1603587276/)” to give me one example. Others: “[Reinventing Organizations](https://www.amazon.com/Reinventing-Organizations-Frederic-Laloux/dp/2960133501/),” by Frederic Laloux; “[Where Do We Go from Here](https://www.amazon.com/Where-Do-We-Here-Community/dp/0807000671/),” by Martin Luther King, Jr.; “[This Is an Uprising](https://www.amazon.com/This-Uprising-Nonviolent-Shaping-Twenty-First/dp/1568585705/),” by Mark and Paul Engler. Several of their members had attended a workshop at a social-movement training institute called Momentum, where they had studied how to effectively combine structured organizing with mass protest. \n\nThe idea was to build a movement that people would join to feel a part of some larger history. “In the Bernie moment, I was seeing so many young people who were, like, ‘I would drop everything to be a part of the political revolution,’ ” Blazevic said. “After the primary ended in their states, there wasn’t anything to be a part of, and we weren’t seeing many movements or organizations rising to that challenge of creating a way for those people to stay meaningfully engaged longer-term. We certainly weren’t seeing it in our own organizing in the climate movement.”\n\nAfter Trump’s election, they responded to the populism of the moment. “We think that the climate movement has missed a big opportunity to tap into the really genuine and valid frustration at the political class in this country that have for our whole lives chosen to prioritize their campaign donors over the interests of young people, of the American people at large,” O’Hanlan said. “So we are here naming who is responsible for this crisis, the fossil-fuel billionaires who have been buying out Washington, D.C.” \n\n“But a big part of our story is not just about naming who’s responsible but actually saying that we can do this, and that this is a problem that we can solve, which I think all of us believe in the deepest core of our hearts,” Weber interjected. “There are solutions that are ready to go and will make people’s lives better and create millions of good jobs, if we can just get these handful of wealthy billionaires and executives and lobbyists and the politicians they collude with out of the way.”

The document was written over a single December weekend by the staff of the freshman representative [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/23/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-historic-win-and-the-future-of-the-democratic-party) and three like-minded progressive groups, none of which existed two years ago: the [Sunrise Movement](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-optimistic-activists-for-a-green-new-deal-inside-the-youth-led-singing-sunrise-movement), a grassroots climate organization; the Justice Democrats, which recruits and supports progressive candidates; and an upstart policy shop called the New Consensus. Just about everyone involved was new to lawmaking. “We spent the weekend learning how to put laws together,” Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, told me. “We looked up how to write resolutions.”\n\nThe format of the document looks familiar: there are sections for “procedure” and “funding.” But its maximalist, aspirational approach is, to say the least, unusual for a legislative document. Its goal is to make the United States greenhouse-gas emission neutral within ten years. That alone would be a historic transformation, but the authors were more ambitious still. Clause (6)(B) begins, “The Plan for a Green New Deal (and the draft legislation) shall recognize that a national, industrial, economic mobilization of this scope and scale is a historic opportunity to virtually eliminate poverty in the United States and to make prosperity, wealth and economic security available to everyone participating in the transformation.” Its seventh subsection suggests, in a dependent clause, the inclusion of a federal jobs guarantee and universal health insurance. The document raises the example of a trillion-dollar investment over ten years, then dismisses it as “wholly inadequate.” To its creators, the scale of the project is not a political complication but a point of pride.\n\nNo one who helped draft the resolution expected it to catch on quickly. But it did. Within a few weeks, more than forty-five Democrats in Congress had voiced support for the project, including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker, as well as Bernie Sanders. Al Gore called it “part of the answer to global inequality.” There are hard limits on how much power the group has won—House Speaker Nancy Pelosi quickly rejected Ocasio-Cortez’s call for a select committee on the Green New Deal—but its influence has been plain. Christy Goldfuss, who served under President Barack Obama as the managing director of the Council on Environmental Quality and now leads the energy and environmental team at the Center for American Progress, said that she has noticed a change in how more senior Democrats are thinking about climate policy. “People are asking how are we going to address climate change at scale, not what’s our building-block approach,” she said. “For me, that is a huge, huge shift, and it would not have happened if the Green New Deal had not come along.” On the campaign trail, and in the House, Democrats have a confident veneer. They are winning elections; they are younger than the opposition; the press is full of appreciations of Pelosi’s tactical savvy. But to watch the unlikely progress of the Green New Deal is to realize how much of the Party’s program and its sources of moral authority remain up for grabs.\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5c38f55340a92a5d39a07f48]||||||\n\n+++\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nLast spring, Chakrabarti, a thirty-two-year-old veteran of the Sanders campaign, was leading Brand New Congress, an organization that he co-founded to recruit progressive candidates, and which helped persuade Ocasio-Cortez to challenge a powerful Democratic incumbent, Joseph Crowley, in New York’s Fourteenth Congressional District. He became Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign manager, and, at first, he said, “Climate wasn’t the frame in which we were talking about this—we were trying to go back to a place where we as a society were taking on massive challenges, like how do you move people out of poverty into the middle class.” Ocasio-Cortez’s early ads emphasized Medicare for All and free college tuition—the Sanders package—but she herself was a more eclectic figure. In interviews, she credited her political awakening to the anti-pipeline protests she joined at Standing Rock. Eventually, Chakrabarti said, the campaign decided “that this idea of doing a gigantic economic transformation was hard to convey,” and that the concept of a Green New Deal could help. “That’s huge. It’s a gigantic national project to transform our economy.” The theme began to surface in the fall. At a campaign event in October in the Queens neighborhood of College Point, Ocasio-Cortez spoke at length about environmental transformation, calling it “one of the most existential issues for our generation and our time.” \n\nOcasio-Cortez has been such a practiced presence in the media that her ascent has seemed, from afar, to flow from some design, but Chakrabarti made it sound more chaotic. Her first act when she arrived in Washington for new-member orientation was to join the Sunrise Movement’s sit-in outside Pelosi’s office, to call for a select committee for the Green New Deal. It started with a request for a retweet from the activists, who knew the young congresswoman and her staff only slightly. “Alexandria was, like, ‘Shoot them a retweet? I’m going to join it,’&nbsp;” Chakrabarti said. He was more judicious—it would be her first major act as a member of Congress, she would be challenging the Speaker, and it could easily backfire. But it didn’t, and, once the protest drew attention, it seemed necessary to explain what the fuss was about. By the weekend, Chakrabarti was at work with the activists in the Google Doc. “If it’s really not possible, then we can revisit,” he said, of their proposal. “The idea is to set the most ambitious thing we can do and then make a plan for it. Why not try?”\n\nIn our conversation, Chakrabarti came across as curious and excitable—he kept using the word “gigantic” to describe the changes he envisioned—and not unlike the young people who, a decade ago, attached themselves to Obama. In the group that joined him to draft the Green New Deal, you can see the emergence of the next generation of the progressive élite: Waleed Shahid, the most prominent spokesman for the Justice Democrats, was the policy director on Cynthia Nixon’s [campaign for governor](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/is-new-york-progressive-enough-for-cynthia-nixon) of New York; Rhiana Gunn-Wright, the policy director for the New Consensus, played the same role for the progressive gubernatorial campaign of Abdul El-Sayed, in Michigan. The leaders of the Sunrise Movement are younger still, in their twenties, with at least as great a sense of urgency. “If you look at the latest United Nations I.P.C.C. report, we need a massive transformation of our economy, unlike any we’ve seen in recent history,” Stephen O’Hanlon, a co-founder of the group, told me. The ubiquitous young left-wing activist Sean McElwee, whose weekly East Village happy hours have drawn senators and Presidential aspirants, published an early sketch of what a Green New Deal policy might look like. Some of these people may have thought of themselves as outsiders but, to older Democrats, they must have looked the way rising leaders of the Party always have. \n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn their draft document, the Green New Deal group writes, “Many will say, ‘Massive government intervention! How in the world can we pay for this?’ The answer is: in the same ways that we paid for the 2008 bank bailout and extended quantitative easing programs, the same ways we paid for World War II and many other wars.” Several of them told me that, on climate policy, Obama had not been audacious enough. “It sounds like hyperbole, but we are fighting to preserve life as we know it,” O’Hanlon said. “A lot of the solutions proposed during the Obama Administration were not up to that scale.” Chakrabarti said that Obama “wasn’t talking about a big mobilization and the solutions were too small.”\n\nThis way of thinking isn’t exactly new, either. When Obama appointed the [prominent environmental activist](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/01/12/greening-the-ghetto) Van Jones as his special adviser for green jobs, in 2009, Jones also [spoke](https://www.thenation.com/article/working-together-green-new-deal/) of a Green New Deal, and was also confident that a climate-driven economic transformation could help correct racial inequities. The Obama economic stimulus, Jones, who is now a CNN commentator, pointed out to me this week, provided more than eighty billion dollars for clean-energy jobs, an investment that the White House expected would be supplemented by a national [cap-and-trade](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/10/11/as-the-world-burns) program. But the cap-and-trade plan failed in the Senate after being labelled, as Jones put it, “so-called socialism.” Jones said he thought the current movement had certain advantages over his—the environmental crisis is deeper and better understood, the grassroots activists are more diverse and more energized—but the vision was the same. It made sense to him that the idea had come back around. “The most exciting, inspiring vision out there is still the Green New Deal,” Jones said. He expected it to keep resurfacing “until it gets done.” \n\nDemocrats have not hesitated, in the Trump era, to call out existential threats to democracy and to the climate. But their campaigns have not often reflected that sense of alarm—their focus in the midterms, a success for the Party, was on the defense of health-care coverage for preëxisting conditions. One early uncertainty of the 2020 Presidential race is how deep a crisis its leaders see. This week a Washington *Post* reporter, in El Paso, caught a bearded Beto O’Rourke in a Hamlet mode, worrying over illegal immigration and the other great topics of the day. O’Rourke praised the Green New Deal for being “bold” and said, “Thank God, the work has been done to articulate the goal, the vision, the means to achieve it.” The *Post’s* reporter, Jenna Johnson, noticed that he was vacillating between “a bright-eyed hope that the United States will soon dramatically change its approach to a whole host of issues and a dismal suspicion that the country is incapable of implementing sweeping change.” Which was it, she asked. “Yeah, I think that’s the question of the moment: Does this still work?” O’Rourke said. By “this,” he seemed to mean America.\n\nThat old Gen-X tick—transparent uncertainty. No such ambiguity from the Green New Deal faction. Lately Chakrabarti has been reading not just into climate policy but into the history of transformative governmental programs. Sounding a little amazed, he told me about F.D.R.’s “[Arsenal of Democracy](https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/fdrarsenalofdemocracy.html)” speech, which spurred the industrial effort to support the Second World War. “Did you know about this?” Chakrabarti asked. “He gave this great speech, and then he also set production targets: a hundred and eighty thousand planes at a time when America was going to produce three thousand, and we ended up producing three hundred thousand.” He went on, “I don’t know if it’s a uniquely American thing, but I associate it that way. People get excited by this idea of, ‘Let’s come together and defeat this huge enemy through innovation, by solving this crisis.’ I think that’s motivating and inspiring.” Of course the millennial left has been able to set the Party’s mood, as it has returned to Washington this month. It has an idea about how to transform bleakness into hope.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7936cecf40192141cc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Democratic Party","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"democratic-party"},{"id":"5c2e1c7a2710c62d1081540c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"alexandria-ocasio-cortez"},{"id":"5c2e1c7a4a08312cd3aa6c3d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Green New Deal","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"green-new-deal"},{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d0520","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Climate Change","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"climate-change"}],"sections":[{"id":"5bf4830ba3db312c4264238f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Political Scene","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-political-scene"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a847dd6207318b5db956","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Benjamin Wallace-Wells began contributing to _The New Yorker_ in 2006, and joined the magazine as a staff writer in 2015.

But then the hypothetical future historian would discover the unifying story of the address, embodied by the people whom Trump honored in his speech. There were fifteen of them. \n\nThree former American soldiers who took part in the invasion of Normandy, in 1944.\n\nOne astronaut, Buzz Aldrin, who took part in planting a flag on the moon.\n\nTwo people who received excessive prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenses, studied the Bible in prison, and were released after more than two decades.\n\nThree descendants of a couple who were robbed and murdered, ostensibly by a man who had no legal status in the United States.\n\nOne *ICE*{:.small} agent, himself an immigrant.\n\nA ten-year-old girl who has had cancer.\n\nA man whose son was killed aboard the U.S.S. Cole.\n\nA policeman who was shot seven times while chasing the gunman in [the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/why-the-tree-of-life-shooter-was-fixated-on-the-hebrew-immigrant-aid-society).\n\nTwo elderly former inmates of Nazi concentration camps.\n\nTrump is certainly not the first President to shape a story by inviting people to be lauded during his State of the Union address. Barack Obama invited [twenty-three](https://www.vox.com/2016/1/12/10755528/state-of-the-union-guests) different people to his last address, in 2016; at least fifteen of them were activists, working on causes including homelessness, opioid addiction, access to education, same-sex marriage, discrimination against Muslims, and more. The stories they embodied were ones of overcoming adversity but also of working with others toward a better future. Trump’s guests, on the other hand, were all survivors.\n\nThey survived D Day.\n\nThey survived decades in American prisons and, through the study of religion, earned second chances in their late middle age.\n\nThey survived unimaginable grief.\n\nThey survived immigration.\n\nThey survived cancer. (Notably, although one of Trump’s more ambitious promises was to eliminate new H.I.V. infections within ten years, there was no guest with a story of surviving with H.I.V.)\n\nThey survived losing a child.\n\nThey survived a mass shooting.\n\nAnd they survived the Holocaust.\n\nThe sole exception to this narrative was the astronaut whose achievement was fifty years old.\n\nThe hypothetical future historian might deduce that Americans lived with a sense of constant danger. They lived in fear of “adversaries abroad,” whom Trump said we must unite to defeat. They dreaded “large, organized caravans” that were “on the march to the United States.” They sent thousands of soldiers to the border to protect them from gang members and drug and sex traffickers, and they considered turning their country into a giant walled fortress in order to fend off “criminal aliens.” They spent more than half of their federal budget on weapons and soldiers and still felt unprotected, so their President had to promise to “rebuild” the military. They also, for more than a century, lived in dread of the spectre of socialism, which their leaders had to promise to hold back.\n\nLiving with a sense of danger so profound and so constant, a people would be unable to think of much beyond immediate survival. They could have little ambition for technological or scientific achievement. They could have no vision of organizing their society in a better, more equitable way. With fear as their only political motivator, their only goal could be a united front. If they felt constantly on the brink of extinction, that might help explain why, on the one hand, they armed themselves obsessively, and, on the other, they put people behind bars for decades at a time. And, living in this constant state of dread, they could not have the presence of mind, or the imagination, to tackle the longer-term danger of climate change—which, of course, makes it less likely that a future historian will be looking at Trump’s State of the Union address at all.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1ecc2710c62d1081563a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1ecc2710c62d1081563a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Survivors","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"survivors"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Survivors","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"survivors"},{"id":"5c2e1e88397f5b30646d07f1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1e88397f5b30646d07f1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"State of the Union","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"state-of-the-union"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"State of the Union","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"state-of-the-union"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"5910a6e62e2e17730741c6b7","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Masha Gessen began contributing to *The New Yorker* in 2014 and became a staff writer in 2017\\.

Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) was scheduled to deliver his second [State of the Union address](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/state-of-the-union) and third speech to Congress, his first since Democrats took the House in November’s midterm elections, the *Times* ran an account of a private lunch held at the White House for news anchors, during which he mocked Democrats including Chuck Schumer (“a nasty son of a bitch”), Joe Biden (“Biden was never very smart. He was a terrible student”), and Elizabeth Warren (“I hope I haven’t wounded Pocahontas too badly”).\n\nThe familiar hollowness of the State of the Union, joined in the past two years by the novel absurdity of Trump standing at the dais, has been compounded this time around by rote calls for unity—routinely made by Presidents chastened by midterm losses—from the mouth of an insult-loving President whose differences with his political opponents are morally irreconcilable. “Together, we can break decades of political stalemate,” he said. “We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future.” The White House expects the unlocking of America’s future to begin on Friday, at an unusual bipartisan summit of lawmakers hosted by the White House’s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, at Camp David. The President will not be there.\n\nTrump’s speech comes on the heels of a shutdown that alienated members of his own party, appalled the country, and cast the state of the State of the Union in doubt—all told, an unqualified victory for [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/nancy-pelosi) and the Democrats, who were all smiles in the chamber Tuesday night before the President arrived. The women of the House Democratic caucus, dressed in stark suffragette white, posed for cheery selfies. Among the members of the Senate were leading figures of the most robust Presidential field the Democratic Party has produced in some time—Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, and Kirsten Gillibrand. Bernie Sanders, one of the last top-tier candidates yet to announce, will deliver a live-streamed response to the President’s address after an official response by Stacey Abrams, now a potential candidate for the Senate in 2020, and one of the Party’s rising stars. Trump is entering the second half of his first term surrounded, eclipsed, and frustrated by a Party surging with energy. None of his bluster tonight can occlude that.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1e88397f5b30646d07f1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"State of the Union","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"state-of-the-union"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c762710c62d10815407","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Politics","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"politics"}],"sections":[{"id":"59f0d2a0d2beb9720f019591","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Current","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"current"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5b90190af241c1681cbddf6f","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Osita Nwanevu joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2018, covering politics and policy in Washington, D.C.

When the President implored the Congress to “end revenge politics,” [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/nancy-pelosi), right behind him, gave an exaggerated, sarcastic clap at Trump. When Trump said that women had filled fifty-eight per cent of new jobs created in the past year, a formation of Democrats in suffragette white (many of whom had got new jobs in November) rose, laughing. The President smiled and acknowledged them. “Don’t sit yet; you’ll like this,” he said, and then pointed out that this Congress had more women than any in history, which led to some vigorous applause. When Trump implored the Democrats to abandon their program of investigation, the cameras found Adam Schiff, the new chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and he just smiled. Most of Trump’s speech was filled with the familiar demagoguery and big talk: Stephen Miller’s snuff-film roll of immigrant crimes, the insistence that Trump had rescued the country from a precipice (“If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea, with potentially millions of people killed”), but the Democrats, for the first time, had some recourse. \n\nSince the midterms, U.S. politics feels like it has reached an intermission. Congress is in an ideological stalemate, and the White House seems mainly to be anticipating the slow, corroding drip of congressional investigations through 2019 and the next Presidential race. Having spent the past two months losing a shutdown fight over his demands for nearly six billion dollars for a border wall, the President had an opportunity on Tuesday to set some new priorities. But he had only the same old ones to offer: criminal-justice reform and infrastructure to raise some bipartisan possibilities; anti-immigration bluster and warm words for North Korea to foreclose it. This was a dud of a speech. But it was also a relief to leave it feeling only dulled and deflated. There were no new horrors here.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1e88397f5b30646d07f1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"State of the Union","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"state-of-the-union"},{"id":"5c2e1c762710c62d10815407","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Politics","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"politics"},{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Congress","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"congress"}],"sections":[{"id":"59f0d2a0d2beb9720f019591","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Current","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"current"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a847dd6207318b5db956","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Benjamin Wallace-Wells began contributing to _The New Yorker_ in 2006, and joined the magazine as a staff writer in 2015.

In his February, 2017, address to a joint session of Congress, he said, “The time for trivial fights is behind us.” In his inaugural [State of the Union speech](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/state-of-the-union), he called on both parties to “summon the unity we need to deliver for the people.” This year, his speechwriters upped the ante. “The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda,” Trump said at the start of his speech. “It is the agenda of the American people.” He went on, “There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country.”\n\nFrom there, the speech went all over the place, including Normandy (stand up, three veterans of D-Day); the moon (stand up, Buzz Aldrin); and Alliteration Abaddon. “We must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution—and embrace the boundless potential of coöperation, compromise, and the common good,” Trump said at one point. “We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance.”\n\nIt was all hot air, of course—a gaseous exhalation delivered to a packed House chamber that is now under Democratic control. After about fifteen minutes of making nice and boasting about the economy, Trump reverted to type and warned the Democrats that, if they wanted him to coöperate with them, they would have to drop the many investigations of him and his Administration that they are now busy launching. “If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation,” he said. “It just doesn’t work that way!”\n\nShortly thereafter, he turned to the subject of his [beloved border wall](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/trumps-dangerous-scapegoating-of-immigrants-at-the-state-of-the-union), saying, “Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.” Then it was onto the “caravans,” MS-13, and the grief-stricken family of an elderly couple who were allegedly murdered, in Trump’s telling, by an undocumented immigrant. After going on in this vein for several minutes, he said, “Simply put, walls work and walls save lives.”\n\nNobody should need reminding that this is the line that Trump took in the run-up to the midterms, which resulted in a heavy defeat for his party. It is also the line he took during the five-week shutdown, which ended with him being forced to back down and reopen the federal government. If he were seriously interested in making the sort of political adjustment that Bill Clinton made after the 1994 midterms, in which the Republicans won the House, he would have first had to acknowledge the scale of his defeat—something he has conspicuously failed to do—and then make some real compromises to the Democrats, such as accepting defeat on the wall. \n\nInstead, he offered the Democrats thin gruel. He did laud the passage of the recent criminal-justice bill, which reformed some draconian sentencing guidelines and led to the release of some long-serving prisoners, two of whom—Alice Marie Johnson and Matthew Charles—were in the spectators’ gallery. But about all that he offered in terms of specific proposals that Democrats might support were vague references to an infrastructure package, cheaper prescription drugs, and paid family leave. And he coupled these suggestions with a call for Congress to outlaw late-term abortions, which was a sop to the evangelical right, and a rote attack on Obamacare.\n\nTrump is nothing if not inconsistent—we all know that. In this instance, the inconsistencies undermined the stated purpose of his speech. About the only time he evoked any real enthusiasm from the Democrats assembled before him was when he hailed the new [female members of Congress](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/the-joyful-defiance-of-the-congresswomen-in-white-at-the-state-of-the-union), many of whom got elected by opposing him personally. ([Even Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-captured-the-horror-of-the-state-of-the-union) joined her colleagues in applauding that line from the speech. They all knew they were cheering at Trump’s expense.)\n\nThat fact is that coöperation and bipartisanship aren’t Trump’s bag: he’s much more comfortable practicing division and aggression. (In an interview with network anchors hours before the speech, he called Joe Biden “dumb” and said that Chuck Schumer “can be a nasty son of a bitch.”) But with the new constellation of power in Washington, he doesn’t have much choice. If he wants to accomplish anything of note, he will have to obtain the agreement of Schumer and [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/nancy-pelosi), who was sitting behind him on Tuesday night as he spoke. Hence his return, at the end of his speech, to the language of conciliation and airy historical allusions. “We must choose whether we are defined by our differences or whether we dare to transcend them,” he said. “We must choose whether we will squander our inheritance or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown.”\n\nUnfortunately for Trump, the Democratic leaders are in no mood for coöperating with him, certainly not on his terms—and he still hasn’t given any indication that he is willing to move beyond them. On Tuesday morning, Schumer took the unusual step of delivering a prebuttal to Trump’s speech from the floor of the Senate. “The state of the Trump Administration is chaos,” he said. As for Pelosi, the Washington *Post* reported that on Tuesday morning she sent out a fund-raising e-mail in which she said she was looking to raise two hundred thousand dollars “to make (Trump’s) second State of the Union completely backfire.” In delivering the Democratic response to Trump on Tuesday night, [Stacey Abrams](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/in-georgia-a-bar-crowd-roars-for-stacey-abramss-state-of-the-union-response), who narrowly lost in her bid to become America’s first black female governor, last November, also criticized Trump directly, saying, “The shutdown was a stunt engineered by the President of the United States, one that defied every tenet of fairness and abandoned not just our people—but our values.” \n\nSchumer and Pelosi are both reacting rationally to the political incentives they face. They know that the Democratic base won’t countenance them supporting anything with Trump’s name attached to it unless it is virtually a Democratic bill. Until the polls demonstrate that a policy of unrelenting resistance and combativeness to the President is hurting Democrats, they will continue to beat Trump like a drum. \n\nTrump, in his gut, probably knows this better than anyone. Through his divisive, ugly rhetoric, his wanton disregard for Presidential norms, and the many bad and cruel policies he has championed, he created the venomous ill-feeling that is now threatening to engulf him; indeed, he has often seemed to revel in it. Nothing in what he said on Tuesday night alters any of that. If history is a guide, he’ll return to his usual belligerent mode within days, perhaps hours.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1e88397f5b30646d07f1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"State of the Union","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"state-of-the-union"},{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Congress","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"congress"},{"id":"5c2e1c8b2bc86f2c9a2449bd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Nancy Pelosi","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"nancy-pelosi"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909e8fb8b51cf59fc4246ae","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1995.

There have been  innumerable tweets, from early-morning “*WITCH HUNT*{: .small}” exclamations to late-night “covfefe” complaints. There have been sit-down interviews both with television networks and print outlets, in which the President has confided his reasons for firing James Comey as F.B.I. director and expounded on the “massive amounts of money” that he says the Presidency has cost him. There have been freewheeling press conferences and impromptu exchanges with journalists on the White House driveway, on Air Force One, or while touring disaster areas—Trump now speaks on camera at least as much as his paid spokespeople do. He has televised his bull sessions with lawmakers and attended scores of campaign rallies, delighting in the roar of the crowd as he holds forth against immigrants or Democrats or the media. He has given an Inaugural Address that one of his predecessors reportedly referred to as “[weird shit](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/03/what-george-w-bush-really-thought-of-trumps-inauguration.html),” and an [Oval Office address](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/the-corrupting-falsehoods-of-trumps-oval-office-speech) calling for border-wall funding that Congress refused to give him. \n\nOn Tuesday night, Trump will give his second State of the Union—his third speech to Congress over all. These addresses have been among his most conventional acts as President. In both previous cases, Trump has stuck to his hour-long scripts, sublimating his complaints and prejudices into an approximation of the language of state. He has resisted his tendency to improvise and stopped short of the “American carnage” imagery of his Inauguration speech, tempering the fear-mongering with impossible promises. \n\n“Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed,” Trump declared, two years ago, in his first address to Congress. “Every problem can be solved.” In that speech, he told the story of the political “earthquake” that brought him to the White House. He had taken office just a few weeks before, and he laid out his agenda—anti-regulation, pro-coal, anti-tax, anti-Obamacare, pro-tariffs, pro-conservative judges—and put a new gloss on his campaign rhetoric. He didn’t speak of firing N.F.L. players for protesting against police brutality; he spoke of “support” for law-enforcement officials. He didn’t speak of deporting millions of undocumented immigrants; he spoke of combatting cartels and gangs and building a “great, great wall along our southern border.” Every address to Congress has two audiences: the people watching at home and the lawmakers sitting in the House chamber. Trump and the Republican Party were still figuring out how their unexpected alliance would work, and he gave the Party plenty of reasons to smile and clap. Vice-President Mike Pence and House Speaker Paul Ryan, sitting in the seats designated for them behind Trump, had the look of men who couldn’t believe their luck. \n\nIn 2018, going into an election year, Trump’s State of the Union was a defense of his record in office. He touted the tax cut that the Republicans had passed and the stock market’s performance. He spoke of a “safe, strong, and proud America” and suggested that Republicans were the country’s true patriots, who “proudly stand for the national anthem” while “totally defending our Second Amendment.” Republicans, many of whom would lose their seats in November, again clapped and cheered for Trump, putting forward a united front against the Democrats, who the cameras caught wearing expressions of skepticism and exasperation. When Trump spoke of a proposal to reduce the price of prescription drugs, he swept an arm at the Democrats, as if daring them not to stand and applaud it. Trump spoke of infrastructure, criminal-justice reform, and manufacturing jobs. “It’s all coming back,” he said. He spoke of keeping Guantánamo Bay open, of moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and of fighting *ISIS*{: .small} and confronting North Korea, Iran, Cuba, and Venezuela. “Our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans,” he said. He spoke of an immigration-policy deal that he liked, which would have granted a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers in exchange for a border wall and a range of other policy changes that immigration opponents have long sought. \n\nThat deal went nowhere. His State of the Union address was postponed by a government shutdown that he brought on in an attempt to get his border wall. The early reports are that Trump will attempt to make his speech one of “unity.” He will be speaking to a different Congress. Pence will still be sitting behind him, but Nancy Pelosi, the new Speaker of the House, will be in Ryan’s place. Republicans are [bristling](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/us/politics/trump-border-wall-republicans.html) at his attempts to force his way on immigration. Another year, another script.

In his February, 2017, address to a joint session of Congress, he said, “The time for trivial fights is behind us.” In his inaugural [State of the Union speech](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/state-of-the-union), he called on both parties to “summon the unity we need to deliver for the people.” This year, his speechwriters upped the ante. “The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda,” Trump said at the start of his speech. “It is the agenda of the American people.” He went on, “There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country.”\n\nFrom there, the speech went all over the place, including Normandy (stand up, three veterans of D-Day); the moon (stand up, Buzz Aldrin); and Alliteration Abaddon. “We must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution—and embrace the boundless potential of coöperation, compromise, and the common good,” Trump said at one point. “We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance.”\n\nIt was all hot air, of course—a gaseous exhalation delivered to a packed House chamber that is now under Democratic control.

famously remarked that the Oval Office “is no place for amateurs.” This is because, as Neustadt pointed out in his book “[Presidential Power and the Modern Presidents](https://www.amazon.com/Presidential-Power-Modern-Presidents-Leadership/dp/0029227968),” which was originally published in 1960, the Presidency is, structurally, a weak office. Its occupant has to deal with Congress and the courts as coequal branches of government. Even inside the sprawling executive branch, it isn’t easy to direct Cabinet secretaries, agency heads, and career public officials, many of whom have their own expertise and agendas. Given this challenging environment, Neustadt concluded, “Presidential power is the power to persuade.” If a President loses the ability to bring other players along with him, he is lost.\n\nMore than a year ago, in a [piece](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/12/4/16733450/donald-trump-weak-president-neustadt) published at Vox, Matthew Glassman, a senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute, argued that Donald Trump was “a weak president” in the Neustadt sense of the term. Glassman pointed to Trump’s low approval ratings, early setbacks that the Administration had suffered, such as court rulings against his travel ban, and the failure to repeal Obamacare. The White House’s victories, such as the passage of a tax-reform bill, “usually involve Trump having adopted the position of the congressional Republicans, not the other way around,” Glassman noted. \n\nBack then, the argument could be made that the Trump Administration, for all its early pratfalls, had time to recover. With substantial tax cuts and spending increases about to go into effect—a Keynesian stimulus in all but name—the economy was likely to perk up, giving the White House the opportunity to build support in other areas. And, as the latest [jobs report](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/what-the-strong-january-jobs-report-tells-us-about-the-economy) demonstrated, the economy did pick up. But Trump’s Presidency, rather than expanding in scope and power in the course of the past year, has continued to shrink and shrivel. As he prepares to deliver his second State of the Union address, Trump looks increasingly like a lame duck.\n\nIt isn’t merely that, with the election of a new Congress, his ability to get new legislation passed has run into a Democratic veto—although, as the failure to get funding for a border wall demonstrated, this is obviously a key development. Within the executive branch, many areas of policy appear to proceed despite Trump’s presence rather than because of it. A recent [exhibit](https://abcnews.go.com/beta-story-container/Politics/americas-allies-pushing-us-trump-policies-top-intel/story?id=60697780): the intelligence community’s issuance of an international-threats assessment that contradicted many of Trump’s claims on key issues, such as the nuclear policies of Iran and North Korea. Meanwhile, damaging leaks emerge daily, demonstrating that the President is neither feared nor respected by those around him—the latest [example](https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-private-schedules-leak-executive-time-34e67fbb-3af6-48df-aefb-52e02c334255.html) being the leaking of his confidential daily schedules to Axios. Over the past three months, according to the internal documents, unstructured “executive time” constituted more than sixty per cent of his day in the Oval Office, suggesting that the President spends more time watching TV and tweeting than he does attending to the affairs of the most powerful nation on Earth. \n\nThe basic problem, Glassman told me, is that Trump, despite the talents he displayed in whipping up his supporters during the 2016 campaign, lacks the skill set to be a successful President. “He’s an amateur in the White House,” Glassman said. “He doesn’t have a lot of experience in governing, and I don’t see a lot of learning going on. He looks hideously weak.”\n\n+++inline-recirc\n+++\n\nNeustadt argued that building Presidential power is a cumulative process. If a President has some early successes and gains a reputation as someone who is able to get things done, other players in Washington tend to fall in line, because they are frightened to cross him. But, if the President is perceived as weak or inattentive, these same players will largely follow their own agendas, which is what has happened in the past two years. “The Republicans in Congress did what they wanted to do: judges, tax cuts,” Glassman pointed out. “And the things that Trump wants, such as the border wall, they just kind of ignored. That was really the story of the 115th Congress.”\n\nA similar dynamic has been evident within the executive branch, where Trump’s tendency to make unilateral declarations, coupled with his inability to follow up on policy details, has allowed White House officials, Cabinet members, and career bureaucrats to operate behind the President’s back. Publicly, they express support for Trump’s edicts, such as his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria. Out of sight, they try to figure out how to work around him. Meanwhile, outsiders with access to the President are constantly trying to push their own agendas, calling him at night or during executive time. “Every one of those people on the phone know this is their opportunity to influence the President of the United States,” Glassman said.\n\nThe result is that, even within the Trump Administration, it’s often not clear what the policy is or whether it might be reversed at any moment. One of the few areas where Trump has stood firm is in his demand for funding for a wall on the border with Mexico. But, with Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats blocking his way despite a five-week partial government shutdown, his insistence on the wall has only highlighted his larger predicament. Yes, he could still try to go around Congress by declaring a national emergency. “But that would just show everyone in Washington how weak he is,” Glassman said. “He can’t persuade anyone in D.C. to go along with him, so he has to resort to these autocratic powers.”\n\nOf course, Trump’s Presidency isn’t over, and he can still do a lot of damage with the powers he holds. Even a weak President can make bad appointments and issue harmful executive orders, such as the ones Trump has issued to roll back environmental regulations. On Monday, he [nominated](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/04/interior-trump-taps-former-lobbyist-david-bernhardt-replace-ryan-zinke/2770952002/) a former lobbyist for the oil and agriculture industries, David Bernhardt, as his next Secretary of the Interior. Since the Republicans still control the Senate, Bernhardt will probably be confirmed. Conceivably, Trump could enlarge his influence by reaching out to the Democrats in an effort to get some significant legislation passed, such as an immigration compromise or an infrastructure bill. (The recently passed criminal-justice bill could serve as a model here.) The State of the Union address will be worth monitoring to see if it contains any moves in this direction. But a speech is just a speech. For the second half of Trump’s first term to be more successful than the first, he would need to transform how he operates. He’d need to become far more disciplined, make more of an effort to build coalitions, and, above all, comport himself in a manner that adds to, rather than detracts from, his public standing. \n\nEvery President “makes his personal impact by the things he says and does,” Neustadt [wrote](http://wikisum.com/w/Neustadt:_Presidential_power). “Accordingly his choices of what he should say and do, and how and when, are his means to conserve and tap the sources of his power. Alternatively, choices are the means by which he dissipates his power.” Having arrived in office in a relatively weak position because of his low poll numbers and the fact that he lost the popular vote, Trump has made a lot of awful choices, and whatever power he had to begin with has been slipping away. Can he resurrect his Presidency? Glassman, for one, is doubtful. “I don’t think there is a way for him to turn it around,” he said. “Because I think the problem is Trump himself.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1e88397f5b30646d07f1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"State of the Union","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"state-of-the-union"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909e8fb8b51cf59fc4246ae","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1995.

He was a terrible student”), and Elizabeth Warren (“I hope I haven’t wounded Pocahontas too badly”).\n\nThe familiar hollowness of the State of the Union, joined in the past two years by the novel absurdity of Trump standing at the dais, has been compounded this time around by rote calls for unity—routinely made by Presidents chastened by midterm losses—from the mouth of an insult-loving President whose differences with his political opponents are morally irreconcilable. “Together, we can break decades of political stalemate,” he said. “We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future.” The White House expects the unlocking of America’s future to begin on Friday, at an unusual bipartisan summit of lawmakers hosted by the White House’s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, at Camp David. The President will not be there.\n\nTrump’s speech comes on the heels of a shutdown that alienated members of his own party, appalled the country, and cast the state of the State of the Union in doubt—all told, an unqualified victory for [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/nancy-pelosi) and the Democrats, who were all smiles in the chamber Tuesday night before the President arrived. The women of the House Democratic caucus, dressed in stark suffragette white, posed for cheery selfies. Among the members of the Senate were leading figures of the most robust Presidential field the Democratic Party has produced in some time—Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, and Kirsten Gillibrand. Bernie Sanders, one of the last top-tier candidates yet to announce, will deliver a live-streamed response to the President’s address after an official response by Stacey Abrams, now a potential candidate for the Senate in 2020, and one of the Party’s rising stars. Trump is entering the second half of his first term surrounded, eclipsed, and frustrated by a Party surging with energy. None of his bluster tonight can occlude that.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1e88397f5b30646d07f1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"State of the Union","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"state-of-the-union"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c762710c62d10815407","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Politics","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"politics"}],"sections":[{"id":"59f0d2a0d2beb9720f019591","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Current","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"current"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5b90190af241c1681cbddf6f","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Osita Nwanevu joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2018, covering politics and policy in Washington, D.C.

For more than a month, hundreds of thousands of federal employees went without paychecks, and many federal agencies stopped working or took increasingly desperate measures to keep the lights on. Trump’s poll numbers slid, and members of his party showed impatience. Late last month, after a failed prime-time appeal for the wall from the Oval Office, Trump finally relented, signing a bill to reopen the government, until February 15th. But he still wants his wall, and the government could shut down again if a long-term funding agreement can’t be reached. On Tuesday night, during the [State of the Union](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/state-of-the-union)—a speech that was delayed a week because of the shutdown—Trump made another prime-time pitch. \n\nDuring the past two years, Trump has learned to modulate his anti-immigrant rhetoric in official settings—to dress it up in the bureaucratic language of federal policy. But, on Tuesday, he offered unfiltered immigrant scapegoating, laying practically all the sins of the country at immigrants’ feet. “Working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration,” Trump declared. “Reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.” Insecure jobs, stagnant wages, underfunded schools and safety-net programs, an embarrassing health-care system, crime rates—immigrants, undocumented or otherwise, are responsible for none of these problems. But here was the President of the United States telling those people willing to hear it that they were. “Year after year,” Trump said, “countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.” This is untrue. There is no undocumented-immigrant murder wave.\n\nTrump can dress up his demand for a wall all he wants. On Tuesday he also spoke of a “smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier,” and about a “common-sense proposal.” But Trump’s border wall wasn’t born as a common-sense proposal; it was campaign-rally red meat. It was an imagined monument to anti-immigrant sentiment, telling people outside the U.S. to stay out. Trump’s shutdown was fomented not by any “crisis” on the actual border but by a political crisis involving Trump’s base, which had taken Trump at his word about the wall and what it would be. No amount of fear-mongering should distract from that.

Its occupant has to deal with Congress and the courts as coequal branches of government. Even inside the sprawling executive branch, it isn’t easy to direct Cabinet secretaries, agency heads, and career public officials, many of whom have their own expertise and agendas. Given this challenging environment, Neustadt concluded, “Presidential power is the power to persuade.” If a President loses the ability to bring other players along with him, he is lost.\n\nMore than a year ago, in a [piece](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/12/4/16733450/donald-trump-weak-president-neustadt) published at Vox, Matthew Glassman, a senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute, argued that Donald Trump was “a weak president” in the Neustadt sense of the term. Glassman pointed to Trump’s low approval ratings, early setbacks that the Administration had suffered, such as court rulings against his travel ban, and the failure to repeal Obamacare. The White House’s victories, such as the passage of a tax-reform bill, “usually involve Trump having adopted the position of the congressional Republicans, not the other way around,” Glassman noted. \n\nBack then, the argument could be made that the Trump Administration, for all its early pratfalls, had time to recover. With substantial tax cuts and spending increases about to go into effect—a Keynesian stimulus in all but name—the economy was likely to perk up, giving the White House the opportunity to build support in other areas. And, as the latest [jobs report](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/what-the-strong-january-jobs-report-tells-us-about-the-economy) demonstrated, the economy did pick up. But Trump’s Presidency, rather than expanding in scope and power in the course of the past year, has continued to shrink and shrivel. As he prepares to deliver his second State of the Union address, Trump looks increasingly like a lame duck.\n\nIt isn’t merely that, with the election of a new Congress, his ability to get new legislation passed has run into a Democratic veto—although, as the failure to get funding for a border wall demonstrated, this is obviously a key development. Within the executive branch, many areas of policy appear to proceed despite Trump’s presence rather than because of it. A recent [exhibit](https://abcnews.go.com/beta-story-container/Politics/americas-allies-pushing-us-trump-policies-top-intel/story?id=60697780): the intelligence community’s issuance of an international-threats assessment that contradicted many of Trump’s claims on key issues, such as the nuclear policies of Iran and North Korea. Meanwhile, damaging leaks emerge daily, demonstrating that the President is neither feared nor respected by those around him—the latest [example](https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-private-schedules-leak-executive-time-34e67fbb-3af6-48df-aefb-52e02c334255.html) being the leaking of his confidential daily schedules to Axios. Over the past three months, according to the internal documents, unstructured “executive time” constituted more than sixty per cent of his day in the Oval Office, suggesting that the President spends more time watching TV and tweeting than he does attending to the affairs of the most powerful nation on Earth. \n\nThe basic problem, Glassman told me, is that Trump, despite the talents he displayed in whipping up his supporters during the 2016 campaign, lacks the skill set to be a successful President. “He’s an amateur in the White House,” Glassman said. “He doesn’t have a lot of experience in governing, and I don’t see a lot of learning going on. He looks hideously weak.”\n\n+++inline-recirc\n+++\n\nNeustadt argued that building Presidential power is a cumulative process. If a President has some early successes and gains a reputation as someone who is able to get things done, other players in Washington tend to fall in line, because they are frightened to cross him. But, if the President is perceived as weak or inattentive, these same players will largely follow their own agendas, which is what has happened in the past two years. “The Republicans in Congress did what they wanted to do: judges, tax cuts,” Glassman pointed out. “And the things that Trump wants, such as the border wall, they just kind of ignored. That was really the story of the 115th Congress.”\n\nA similar dynamic has been evident within the executive branch, where Trump’s tendency to make unilateral declarations, coupled with his inability to follow up on policy details, has allowed White House officials, Cabinet members, and career bureaucrats to operate behind the President’s back. Publicly, they express support for Trump’s edicts, such as his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria. Out of sight, they try to figure out how to work around him. Meanwhile, outsiders with access to the President are constantly trying to push their own agendas, calling him at night or during executive time. “Every one of those people on the phone know this is their opportunity to influence the President of the United States,” Glassman said.\n\nThe result is that, even within the Trump Administration, it’s often not clear what the policy is or whether it might be reversed at any moment. One of the few areas where Trump has stood firm is in his demand for funding for a wall on the border with Mexico. But, with Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats blocking his way despite a five-week partial government shutdown, his insistence on the wall has only highlighted his larger predicament. Yes, he could still try to go around Congress by declaring a national emergency. “But that would just show everyone in Washington how weak he is,” Glassman said. “He can’t persuade anyone in D.C. to go along with him, so he has to resort to these autocratic powers.”\n\nOf course, Trump’s Presidency isn’t over, and he can still do a lot of damage with the powers he holds. Even a weak President can make bad appointments and issue harmful executive orders, such as the ones Trump has issued to roll back environmental regulations. On Monday, he [nominated](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/04/interior-trump-taps-former-lobbyist-david-bernhardt-replace-ryan-zinke/2770952002/) a former lobbyist for the oil and agriculture industries, David Bernhardt, as his next Secretary of the Interior. Since the Republicans still control the Senate, Bernhardt will probably be confirmed. Conceivably, Trump could enlarge his influence by reaching out to the Democrats in an effort to get some significant legislation passed, such as an immigration compromise or an infrastructure bill. (The recently passed criminal-justice bill could serve as a model here.) The State of the Union address will be worth monitoring to see if it contains any moves in this direction. But a speech is just a speech. For the second half of Trump’s first term to be more successful than the first, he would need to transform how he operates. He’d need to become far more disciplined, make more of an effort to build coalitions, and, above all, comport himself in a manner that adds to, rather than detracts from, his public standing. \n\nEvery President “makes his personal impact by the things he says and does,” Neustadt [wrote](http://wikisum.com/w/Neustadt:_Presidential_power). “Accordingly his choices of what he should say and do, and how and when, are his means to conserve and tap the sources of his power. Alternatively, choices are the means by which he dissipates his power.” Having arrived in office in a relatively weak position because of his low poll numbers and the fact that he lost the popular vote, Trump has made a lot of awful choices, and whatever power he had to begin with has been slipping away. Can he resurrect his Presidency? Glassman, for one, is doubtful. “I don’t think there is a way for him to turn it around,” he said. “Because I think the problem is Trump himself.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1e88397f5b30646d07f1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1e88397f5b30646d07f1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"State of the Union","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"state-of-the-union"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"State of the Union","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"state-of-the-union"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"5909e8fb8b51cf59fc4246ae","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1995.

Last week, he was publicly sparring with his own intelligence chiefs and getting an official rebuke from Senate Republicans for the nature of his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan. None of that is likely to have improved his mood as he prepared for the State of the Union address, on Tuesday, after it had been postponed by a week. That delay was due to the fact that [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/nancy-pelosi) had triumphed in her first confrontation with the President since resuming her role as the Speaker of the House. She had done so maybe not by “dog walking” Trump, as the rapper Cardi B [might put it,](https://twitter.com/iamcardib/status/1088897148425404421) but by managing to end a deeply unpopular government shutdown, without giving him his wall, compelling him to put off his speech till the government reopened, and creating an opportunity for negotiations that could lead to compromise legislation on border security.\n\nTrump’s handling of the longest-ever [government shutdown](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/government-shutdown), which left eight hundred thousand federal employees without pay for thirty-five days, certainly showcases the crudeness of his governing style, as does his repeated threat to declare a [national](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/is-donald-trump-about-to-declare-a-national-emergency-at-the-border) [emergency](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/can-donald-trump-invoke-emergency-powers-to-get-his-wall) if he doesn’t get a wall. The standoff may also damage his reëlection prospects, especially if no border agreement is reached and the government shuts down again, as it is scheduled to do in that case, on February 15th. (Last Thursday, Trump told the _Times_ that he thought further talks were “[a waste of time](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/us/politics/trump-wall-investigations-interview.html?module=inline),” and hinted that he would just act on his own after the deadline.) Nobody comes out of this entirely clean, but polls show that more Americans blame the President than blame the congressional Democrats, and it’s easy to imagine Democratic 2020 campaign ads looping the sound bite of Trump telling Pelosi and Senator [Chuck Schumer](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/chuck-schumer) that he was “proud” to close the government.\n\nPerhaps the most consequential aspect of these events is what they have revealed about the Administration’s cluelessness when it comes to the everyday lives of Americans. No one expects Trump to show, say, racial sensitivity or a plausible interest in gender politics. Expectations concerning his general probity, his commitment to paying his fair share of taxes, and his ability to distance himself from meddling Russians and dictators who flatter him are similarly low. What the self-described billionaire President and his Administration are still supposed to have, though, is an affinity for working-class Americans.\n\nYet last week, on CNBC, there was Wilbur Ross, the Commerce Secretary, saying, when asked about furloughed workers who were resorting to food banks, “I know they are, and I don’t really quite understand why.” Ross, who became extremely rich in the business of restructuring failing companies, explained that “there’s no real reason” that people who weren’t getting paid couldn’t just go out and get a loan. He didn’t seem familiar—nor did Trump, in his mentions of the shut-out workers—with the concept of living paycheck to paycheck, or with the statistic, released last year by the Federal Reserve Board, that forty per cent of Americans would have trouble covering an emergency expense of just four hundred dollars. Then there was Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, telling “PBS NewsHour” that workers furloughed during the shutdown were “better off,” since they could go on vacation without having to use their vacation days.\n\nTrump also had nothing much to say about the plight of the hundreds of thousands of government contractors—many of them low-wage earners, such as janitors, cafeteria workers, and security guards in government buildings—who are not guaranteed the back pay that career employees of the federal government will get. Héctor Figueroa, the president of a union that represents some of those workers, [told](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/01/29/lowest-paid-shutdown-workers-arent-getting-back-pay/) the Washington _Post_ that they “have been living on the edge of disaster for five weeks,” adding that many “are facing eviction, power shut-offs, hunger and even going without lifesaving medications.”\n\nAt the same time, Trump’s larger vision for rebuilding blue-collar jobs took a couple of blows. A report that the U.S. Energy Information Administration released last month showed that coal production had fallen in 2018, largely owing to competition from cheap natural gas. That was despite Trump’s attempts to shore up an industry he has consistently championed, by, among other things, scrapping the Clean Power Plan and appointing as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency first the regulation-crushing Oklahoman [Scott Pruitt](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/02/scott-pruitts-dirty-politics) and then, [when he left](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/scott-pruitt-is-gone-but-the-trump-administrations-climate-negligence-remains), amid scandals, the former coal-company lobbyist [Andrew Wheeler](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/in-andrew-wheeler-trump-gets-a-cannier-epa-chief).\n\nMeanwhile, Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics giant, waffled on its promise to build a factory in Wisconsin that would create thousands of manufacturing jobs. First, the company suggested that it wouldn’t build the factory, after all, and then, on Friday, following a phone call from Trump, it said that it would, but left the number of blue-collar jobs that it would provide unclear. At a White House event announcing the deal, in 2017, Trump had bragged of his friendly relationship with Terry Gou, the head of Foxconn, but changes in what the company called the “global market environment” were making that bonhomie hard to count on.\n\nAll these misfires create opportunities for the Democrats to show that they are committed to generating jobs and to protecting people from the harshest forces of the global market. They can start by trying to pass legislation to guarantee back pay for contract workers who were cut off by the shutdown; a handful of Democratic senators have already introduced a bill, the Fair Compensation for Low-Wage Contractor Employees Act, to rectify the situation. In the coming weeks, they can also work to fill in what a [Green New Deal](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/creating-a-road-map-for-a-green-new-deal) jobs program might look like. They can support infrastructure spending, introduce legislation to raise the minimum wage, and focus, in the House investigations of Trump, on some issues of basic fairness for ordinary Americans, such as the Administration’s weakening of the [Affordable Care Act](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/affordable-care-act). They can show themselves to be the real party of the American working class—and find a Presidential candidate, among the growing Democratic field, who can bring that point home. ♦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"592dfa44d5fda942c34a0b61","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Comment","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"comment"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a033f2179605b11ad996f","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Margaret Talbot joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2003.\nPreviously, she was a contributing writer at the New York *Times\nMagazine* and, from 1995 to 1999, an editor at *The New Republic.* Her\nstories, covering legal issues, social policy, and popular culture, have\nappeared, in addition to in the *Times Magazine* and *The New\nRepublic,* in *The Atlantic Monthly, National Geographic,* and\nthe *Times Book Review*.

A couple of hours earlier, the Labor Department [reported](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf) that payrolls had increased by three hundred and four thousand in January, which was about a hundred and thirty thousand more jobs than economists on Wall Street had been predicting. The job gains were widely spread across the economy, with the construction, health-care, retail, and leisure-and-hospitality sectors showing particular strength. The report also showed that wages are still rising at an annual rate of more than three per cent, while consumer price inflation is falling, because of cheaper energy prices. That means that inflation-adjusted wages are rising, as well, which is key.\n\nAs I’ve said many times before, it is unwise to read too much into one month’s job figures. They are drawn from a sample survey carried out by the government and have a pretty large statistical margin of error attached to them. They sometimes get revised substantially in subsequent months. Furthermore, they can be distorted by temporary factors, such as freak weather conditions. After Friday’s report came out, a number of analysts suggested that milder weather than usual during the first few weeks of January could have accounted for as many as a hundred thousand extra hires.\n\nMaybe that was the case, but, even taking all these cautionary notes into account, the jobs report was surprisingly strong. It comes at a time that economic growth in China and Europe is slowing; the U.S. stock market has recently been through a [shaky period](https://www.thestreet.com/markets/stocks-rise-monday-on-hopes-for-united-states-and-china-trade-talks-14821901); some prominent economists, such as Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury Secretary, have [warned](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/be-prepared-a-recession-is-significantly-likely-in-the-next-two-years/2019/01/07/628c67b8-12a3-11e9-b6ad-9cfd62dbb0a8_story.html) about a possible recession; and, just this week, the Federal Reserve has [pressed](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-powell-federal-reserve-20190130-story.html) the pause button on its policy of raising interest rates. Despite all this, employers are still hiring at a healthy rate, as they have been doing for many months now.\n\nIn an analysis of Friday’s report, Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, [pointed out](http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/january-jobs-another-upside-surprise-shows-the-benefits-of-closing-in-on-full-employment/) that, in the past three months, job growth has averaged two hundred and forty-one thousand a month, and in the past year it has averaged two hundred and thirty-four thousand a month. With all this hiring going on, and vacancies plentiful, many people who had retired or dropped out of the labor force have returned to it. In the past twelve months, the labor force has risen by more than 2.1 million. But, even with more people looking for work, job growth has been strong enough to keep the unemployment rate at or below four per cent, and employers have been forced to raise wages in order to retain their own employees and find new ones.\n\nIn other words, American workers are finally enjoying economic conditions that favor them over employers. This is drawing people back into the labor force and producing higher wages. Indeed, Bernstein suggested that recent wage growth has probably been strong enough to tilt the over-all split between wages and profits in the direction of workers, which would reverse long-standing trends. In summing up the lessons of the jobs figures, Bernstein wrote, “First, in an economy with too little worker bargaining power and too much inequality, the benefits of closing in on full employment are powerful and equalizing. And second, Chair Powell and the FOMC were smart to put interest-rate hikes on hold. There’s non-inflationary room-to-run in this job market!”\n\nThat there is, but how much room? The Fed’s decision to call a time-out on raising interest rates was predicated on the assumption that the economy is likely to slow down in the coming months, which would keep inflationary pressures at bay. Perhaps this will happen, but the boffo payrolls figure for January was accompanied by another [strong report](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ism-factory-index-rebounds-in-january-2019-02-01) for industrial production. A separate indicator—consumer sentiment—did fall sharply last month. Most analysts attributed that to the government shutdown. Now that the shutdown has ended, consumer sentiment will probably pick up again. (The shutdown didn’t significantly affect the jobs report: federal workers who were furloughed were counted as employed.)\n\nFriday’s strong numbers are a reminder that the American economy isn’t a zippy speedboat that can stop and start at short notice. It’s a vast supertanker that tends to plow ahead once it has built up some momentum. Bringing it shuddering to a halt requires something dramatic, such as the bursting of an asset-price bubble, a big financial crisis of the sort we saw in 2008, or sharply higher interest rates. Right now, none of those things is in place. \n\nOn the other hand, the Trump-G.O.P. tax stimulus is running down, and the trade war with China is affecting manufacturing adversely. Ian Shepherdson, a chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, thinks that these factors could cause G.D.P. growth to fall, from about three per cent, in 2018, to closer to two per cent, in 2019\\. “But I don’t think it is going to slow down enough to get the Fed off the hook when it comes to the labor market,” he said. “The fact is, wage growth is accelerating.” In the past twelve months, it has risen, from 2.6 per cent to 3.3 per cent, according to Shepherdson’s calculations. With low unemployment continuing, and workers realizing they have more bargaining power than they have had in a long time, wage inflation will continue to rise, he predicted. The big question, he added, is how the Fed will react when this happens.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1ca7e56e652c902746a4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Economy","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"economy"},{"id":"5c2e20a322d4972cd5b835b1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Jobs Report","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"jobs-report"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909e8fb8b51cf59fc4246ae","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1995.

The photograph in question was in his 1984 Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook, and it appeared, as he conceded, “with others I submitted, on a page with my name on it.” One of the people wore blackface and a costume—plaid pants, a bow tie, a puffy wig, and a tilted porkpie hat—that added to the crudeness and the cruelty of the racist caricature; the other person was in a hooded Ku Klux Klan uniform, which added a threat of violence. Both are holding what look like beer cans, as Northam is in another photograph in the spread that is clearly of him. (His yearbook quote: “There are more old drunks than old doctors in this world so I think I’ll have another beer.”) On Friday, hours after a conservative Web site had published—and others had quickly confirmed—the existence of the page, Northam, who is a Democrat, had apologized “for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo.” His press conference the next day was a reversal, in which he repeated a variation on the same line more than a dozen times: “I am not either of the people in the photo”; “I am not the person in that photo”; “That is not my person in that picture”; “I truly do not believe that I am in the picture”; and, almost existentially, “The picture is not me.”\n\nThe one useful aspect of Northam’s repetition of the “not me” line is that it provides a rough index of some of the ways in which the press conference was insulting, beginning with this one: “I think all of you will be reassured to see that I am not in that photograph.” The identity of the people in the photograph, which Northam thought “facial recognition” technology might help pin down, is only part of the problem, though. Including that picture in the yearbook was itself an act of publicizing and magnifying hate, regardless of whether Northam was one of the people in it. Northam, on Saturday, claimed that he had somehow never even seen the photo before, that he didn’t buy the yearbook, and that some mix-up in the yearbook office—“a number of photos laid out on a table and someone is pasting those on page after page”—must have led to its inclusion. He said that he’d been told of such mistakes occurring. He added, “I recognize that many people will find this difficult to believe,” and yet he expected them to do so. The scenario is, indeed, improbable. Nor did it help that Northam repeatedly confined the larger problem of the photo to the simple question of who was in it, as when he said, at another point in the press conference,  “What caused this stir-up yesterday, I am not responsible for. That is not me in that photo.” And there are other questions: Did no one mention the image to him when the yearbook came out? Did it make sense to his classmates that he would represent himself that way? And how could he believe that a story involving such a chain of cosmic coincidences would “reassure” anyone?\n\nNortham did say, on Saturday, that he had “darkened” his face as part of a Michael Jackson costume for a dance contest held in San Antonio, Texas, in 1984, when he was an Army officer. This prompted another version of the not-me line: “It is because my memory of that episode is so vivid that I truly do not believe I am in the picture in my yearbook.” He apologized for that but, again, seemed to find the whole incident exculpatory—a lesser sin that deflected from the more damaging one. The blackface M.J. was bad, he conceded, but still a “contrast” to the image in the yearbook, in part because of the presence of the man in the Klan outfit. One open question, beyond the baseline of blackface awfulness, is the extent to which Northam used Jackson as a vehicle for making a mockery of blackness itself. It is a bad sign that Northam remembers applying, as a skin darkener, not foundation or powder or even grease paint but shoe polish. Or, as he put it, “just a little bit of shoe polish to put under my, or on my cheeks, and the reason I used a very little bit is because, I don’t know if anybody’s ever tried that, you cannot get shoe polish off.”\n\nNo one in the press conference volunteered having tried it. Where was Northam getting his shoe-polish advice in 1984? Northam, as a politician, has been known for making an effort to connect to and represent Virginia’s African-American community. He made a point of visiting predominantly black churches during his campaign (the pastor of his own church is African-American, and accompanied him to the press conference) and has championed issues that are important to the community, such as voting rights, and strongly condemned the white-supremacist violence in Charlottesville in 2017\\. And yet it was not until his 2017 campaign for governor, he said, that a conversation with a black member of his staff triggered in him the realization that there might have been a problem with the whole Michael Jackson episode. He said in the press conference that he had won the dance contest; there was a moment in which he’d seemed ready to moonwalk for the reporters present, until his wife interjected, saying, “inappropriate circumstances.” Who did he think his audience was when he said, remembering his youth on Virginia’s Eastern Shore, “I suspect I’ve had as much exposure to people of color as anybody”?\n\nAmong those not reassured were the Virginia legislature’s black caucus and various civil-rights groups, including the N.A.A.C.P., who, along with a raft of senior Democratic politicians, have called on Northam to resign, which he’d refused to do. (If he does, he will be replaced by the lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax, who is African-American.) One reporter asked Northam if he ought to resign out of respect for their views. His reply amounted to a suggestion that, if African-American leaders just paid attention to what he was saying, they would come around: “I really think, if they will listen to me—again, I hate to be so redundant, but for them to know that this was not me in that picture,” he said. “That was not Ralph Northam. And I hope that they will accept that and I hope that they will take my word.” Northam does not seem to realize that tending to his credibility is really not their job.  \n\nA question that reporters kept returning to was why Northam had initially said that he was in the photograph if, as he said later, his first, horrified reaction was, “This can’t be me.” Was it, as one reporter put it, part of a “life style”? Northam was particularly incoherent on this point. In part, he blamed the hubbub of phone calls from reporters and people who were deeply hurt. (Last week, he’d also caused hurt with comments about very late-term abortions, which made it sound as if Northam, who is a pediatric neurologist, were offering a scenario for facilitating the death of a severely disabled newborn; he said that his remarks were “mischaracterized.”) He did say he always knew that he wasn’t the man in the Klan uniform, although his initial apology hadn’t been specific about that. But he also admitted that he hadn’t, at first, been quite so sure about the man in blackface, given that the photo was on his page. “I didn’t know at the time”; in the rush, “I didn’t study it as well as I should”; “Last night, I finally had a chance to sit down and look at the photograph in detail. It is definitely not me. I can tell by looking at it.”\n\nHe added, “It has taken time for me to make sure that it is not me.” It has taken, perhaps, thirty-five years. Northam might have done better to forthrightly say that the Northam of today would never have appeared in, chosen, or countenanced such an image without insisting at that late point that he was absolutely certain that no version of Ralph Northam ever did. Early in his press conference, Northam read a prepared statement in which he said, “In some ways, my personal history mirrors that of this Commonwealth. There are actions and behaviors in my past that were hurtful, but, like Virginia, I have also made significant progress in how I approach these issues.” But by the time he stepped off the stage he had, unfortunately, left the impression that he still could not fully see himself in the picture of Virginia’s—and America’s—history of racism. That failure alone is grave enough, and  facial-recognition technologies won’t do much to ameliorate it. Nor will Northam’s belief in the power of his own image of himself to define and excuse him. “I am convinced that is not my picture,” he said. “That is not who I am.”\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1e824a08312cd3aa6e18","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1e824a08312cd3aa6e18","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Ralph

Northam immediately apologized for appearing in the photo, but he then changed his story and said that neither person in the photograph was him; he did, however, say that he had once put shoe polish on his face as part of a Michael Jackson costume. By the end of the weekend, many members of the Virginia and national Democratic parties had called for Northam’s resignation.\n\nTo discuss the subject of blackface and its historical role in American politics, culture, and racism, I spoke by phone with Eric Lott, who teaches American studies at the *CUNY*{: .small} Graduate Center and is the author of  “[Love & Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy & the American Working Class](https://www.amazon.com/Love-Theft-Blackface-Minstrelsy-American/dp/0195320557).” An edited and condensed version of our conversation is below.\n\n__What did you think when you saw the photograph?__\n\nHere we go again. [Blackface] never seems to die as a collegiate, fraternity activity, which follows on decades of local performances of various kinds, Kiwanis Clubs and Rotary Clubs, which follows on the very long history of both Hollywood and vaudeville stage performance going back into the early nineteenth century. \n\n__The photo was obviously offensive and awful, but it was also weird if you don’t know this culture. There is a guy in blackface and a guy in a Klan hood. What’s the joke they are going for?__\n\nI know. I was trying to puzzle that out because that really is—to situate it in full context, with the paired costumes—an interesting thing to try and figure out, over and above the embrace of the blackface guise. And there is more than one of those, too.\n\n__What do you mean by that?__\n\nThere are various types of blackface characters one could adopt. I gather there is a Michael Jackson outfit lurking somewhere in his closet, but that is not what this is. Although it’s not far from it. There is a bow tie. There is a jacket. It’s kind of dandyish, speaking of one of the prototypes from the minstrel show, the Zip Coon figure. I think it is very interesting that this is a very particular kind of costume. But paired with the Klan outfit, as though they belong together. Lest there be any murkiness about it, it is just two versions of white supremacy, one in blackface and one not. But there is some kind of gesture that would seem to remove the twenty-five-year-olds doing it from the history they are impersonating, in which a black person summons forth that person’s white-supremacist counterpart or policer or enforcer. I sense in the costume an avowal that they are part of this history, but also an attempt to lampoon it, as though it is not them, it’s these figures not of their time, or something like that.\n\n__Is pairing these things together something that you see in the iconography of blackface?__\n\nYeah, at Halloween- and fraternity-party-type things you will find a Klan person with a noose around a person in blackface’s neck. A scripted scenario in which a racist is assaulting a black American, both of them played by whites. The psychic sources of wanting to replay that scenario is anyone’s guess.\n\n__Can you talk more about the different types of blackface we have seen throughout history, and what regional and class differences there are?__\n\nThe prototypical ones were launched in the eighteen-forties and eighteen-fifties in blackface performance, in the minstrel-show proper, which was mostly a Northern, urban phenomenon, although it had offshoots and variations everywhere, out in the West, the Northwest, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, the current Midwest. There were versions in the South, as well. Those are solo or duo performances. But for several decades the full-blown performance was five or so performers onstage, with various instrumentation and characters. \n\nBut the two archetypes of blackface are separated by geography and class. One is the Northern dandy, Zip Coon. The Zip Coon character is dandified, probably being lampooned for assuming airs and intellect beyond his station. And the Southern plantation African-American type, Jim Crow, from which the system of legal segregation took its name, later in the century, is the happy-go-lucky, somewhat mischievous, enslaved person down South. Both these characters, Zip Coon and Jim Crow, had songs named after them. And variants on those and combinations of their features show up later in vaudeville and film and Halloween parties and Halloween characters. When people did Obama in blackface, it is very much a play on Zip Coon and dandified blackface characters. And this particular one seems to have come out of that tradition.\n\n__Were the timeframes that these two archetypes showed up in the same?__\n\nThey were simultaneous. In the eighteen-forties they come into clarity. By the eighteen-sixties, after the Civil War, there are changes to the business of blackface performance. African-American performers themselves get into the game, and those types begin to shift, so that by the time of the “coon show” proper, which is more eighteen-nineties, where you have black performers themselves in blackface, you have really urban, knife-wielding hustler types, and also the rural chicken-thief type. But those first two, in the eighteen-forties and eighteen-fifties, really set the terms for later variations. \n\n__Klan iconography and people who are not in the Klan wearing Klan outfits: How does that history mirror or differentiate itself from people using blackface?__\n\nBoth of them are initially and by definition theatrical guises. The Klan outfit is this over-the-top, theatricalized, performative setup in which you have these gowns and robes. It is ritualized, certainly, but there is a weird investment in costume, as there is in blackface. I don’t think it’s just a Southern thing. [Some] of the strongholds of the Klan were places like Northern Indiana and Michigan. The way in which race and thinking about race, signifiers of race, open immediately onto theatricalizing of race, performance of it, by crossing over to put on blackface. You can’t just go around being white. You have to put on this robe and you have to demonstrate and insist on your whiteness by, oddly, covering it up. They all just metastasize into crazier and crazier sorts of suggestions about what race means to white people in the United States.\n+++inline-recirc\n+++\n__We do that by electing people, too.__\n\nExactly. I have just been reading the recent Donald Trump [tanning reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/us/politics/trump-tan.html), and he invests a fair amount of time, it appears, in his own costume, his own hair and skin treatment, which is, you know, not unrelated to all this. It is just a different kind of, at some level, racialized performance of fame, whiteness, Presidentialness.\n\n__He was doing this before he became President, but, yeah.__ \n\nThat’s right.\n\n__Is there anything you would like to hear Northam say that you think would be helpful for people trying to understand this?__\n\nI think he has already said it, with the masks. I don’t think there is anything he could say that would be more eloquent than what he did say with the mask, which was a kind of speech about his racial feeling, his self-sense of his whiteness, his sense of his relation to the color line between black and white. And any attempt to read his own act of racialized speech would fall short of what he has already said. In terms of his own analysis, I am not expecting much.

A couple of hours earlier, the Labor Department [reported](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf) that payrolls had increased by three hundred and four thousand in January, which was about a hundred and thirty thousand more jobs than economists on Wall Street had been predicting. The job gains were widely spread across the economy, with the construction, health-care, retail, and leisure-and-hospitality sectors showing particular strength. The report also showed that wages are still rising at an annual rate of more than three per cent, while consumer price inflation is falling, because of cheaper energy prices. That means that inflation-adjusted wages are rising, as well, which is key.\n\nAs I’ve said many times before, it is unwise to read too much into one month’s job figures. They are drawn from a sample survey carried out by the government and have a pretty large statistical margin of error attached to them. They sometimes get revised substantially in subsequent months. Furthermore, they can be distorted by temporary factors, such as freak weather conditions. After Friday’s report came out, a number of analysts suggested that milder weather than usual during the first few weeks of January could have accounted for as many as a hundred thousand extra hires.\n\nMaybe that was the case, but, even taking all these cautionary notes into account, the jobs report was surprisingly strong. It comes at a time that economic growth in China and Europe is slowing; the U.S. stock market has recently been through a [shaky period](https://www.thestreet.com/markets/stocks-rise-monday-on-hopes-for-united-states-and-china-trade-talks-14821901); some prominent economists, such as Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury Secretary, have [warned](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/be-prepared-a-recession-is-significantly-likely-in-the-next-two-years/2019/01/07/628c67b8-12a3-11e9-b6ad-9cfd62dbb0a8_story.html) about a possible recession; and, just this week, the Federal Reserve has [pressed](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-powell-federal-reserve-20190130-story.html) the pause button on its policy of raising interest rates. Despite all this, employers are still hiring at a healthy rate, as they have been doing for many months now.\n\nIn an analysis of Friday’s report, Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, [pointed out](http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/january-jobs-another-upside-surprise-shows-the-benefits-of-closing-in-on-full-employment/) that, in the past three months, job growth has averaged two hundred and forty-one thousand a month, and in the past year it has averaged two hundred and thirty-four thousand a month. With all this hiring going on, and vacancies plentiful, many people who had retired or dropped out of the labor force have returned to it. In the past twelve months, the labor force has risen by more than 2.1 million. But, even with more people looking for work, job growth has been strong enough to keep the unemployment rate at or below four per cent, and employers have been forced to raise wages in order to retain their own employees and find new ones.\n\nIn other words, American workers are finally enjoying economic conditions that favor them over employers. This is drawing people back into the labor force and producing higher wages. Indeed, Bernstein suggested that recent wage growth has probably been strong enough to tilt the over-all split between wages and profits in the direction of workers, which would reverse long-standing trends. In summing up the lessons of the jobs figures, Bernstein wrote, “First, in an economy with too little worker bargaining power and too much inequality, the benefits of closing in on full employment are powerful and equalizing. And second, Chair Powell and the FOMC were smart to put interest-rate hikes on hold. There’s non-inflationary room-to-run in this job market!”\n\nThat there is, but how much room? The Fed’s decision to call a time-out on raising interest rates was predicated on the assumption that the economy is likely to slow down in the coming months, which would keep inflationary pressures at bay. Perhaps this will happen, but the boffo payrolls figure for January was accompanied by another [strong report](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ism-factory-index-rebounds-in-january-2019-02-01) for industrial production. A separate indicator—consumer sentiment—did fall sharply last month. Most analysts attributed that to the government shutdown. Now that the shutdown has ended, consumer sentiment will probably pick up again. (The shutdown didn’t significantly affect the jobs report: federal workers who were furloughed were counted as employed.)\n\nFriday’s strong numbers are a reminder that the American economy isn’t a zippy speedboat that can stop and start at short notice. It’s a vast supertanker that tends to plow ahead once it has built up some momentum. Bringing it shuddering to a halt requires something dramatic, such as the bursting of an asset-price bubble, a big financial crisis of the sort we saw in 2008, or sharply higher interest rates. Right now, none of those things is in place. \n\nOn the other hand, the Trump-G.O.P. tax stimulus is running down, and the trade war with China is affecting manufacturing adversely. Ian Shepherdson, a chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, thinks that these factors could cause G.D.P. growth to fall, from about three per cent, in 2018, to closer to two per cent, in 2019\\. “But I don’t think it is going to slow down enough to get the Fed off the hook when it comes to the labor market,” he said. “The fact is, wage growth is accelerating.” In the past twelve months, it has risen, from 2.6 per cent to 3.3 per cent, according to Shepherdson’s calculations. With low unemployment continuing, and workers realizing they have more bargaining power than they have had in a long time, wage inflation will continue to rise, he predicted. The big question, he added, is how the Fed will react when this happens.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1ca7e56e652c902746a4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1ca7e56e652c902746a4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Economy","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"economy"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Economy","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"economy"},{"id":"5c2e20a322d4972cd5b835b1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e20a322d4972cd5b835b1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Jobs Report","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"jobs-report"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Jobs Report","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"jobs-report"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"5909e8fb8b51cf59fc4246ae","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1995.

At the time, the richest one per cent of families controlled about forty per cent of all household wealth—defined as stocks, bonds, other financial assets, equity in private businesses, trusts, real estate, and bank deposits—while much of the population had virtually no wealth at all once debts and mortgages were taken into account. To address this disparity, Wolff called for the introduction of an annual tax on wealth. Aware that this might be considered a radical idea, he kept his proposed tax rates at pretty low levels. Under his plan, households with a net worth of a hundred thousand dollars would pay five cents in tax on every hundred dollars of their wealth; the rate would rise to thirty cents per hundred dollars for households worth a million dollars or more. (Back then, about three per cent of U.S. households fell into the latter bracket.)\n\nDespite the modest scale of Wolff’s proposal, it didn’t get much traction in the policy world. Prior to publishing the book, he did have a lunch meeting with Bill Bradley, the Democratic senator from New Jersey, where they discussed the idea, but that was as far as it went. “He sounded enthusiastic at the lunch, but when push came to shove he walked away,” Wolff recalled when I spoke with him earlier this week. “He thought that politically it was dynamite.”\n\nTwenty-five years later, how have things changed? Last week, Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic Presidential candidate, put forward a [wealth tax](https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senator-warren-unveils-proposal-to-tax-wealth-of-ultra-rich-americans) that would be much bigger than the one Wolff proposed but also much more narrowly focussed. Under Warren’s plan, the tax rate on wealth would be two per cent, but it would only apply to American households worth at least fifty million dollars, of which there are fewer than eighty thousand. Fortunes of a billion dollars or more would be taxed at three per cent—ten times the top rate in Wolff’s plan. Not everyone is thrilled about Warren’s proposal, of course. During a visit to New Hampshire, Mike Bloomberg, who is considering running for President in 2020, as a Democrat, [claimed](https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/1090305780945948673?s=20) that Warren’s proposal was unconstitutional and brought up Venezuela. Howard Schultz, the former Starbucks C.E.O. who is [thinking of entering the Presidential race](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/howard-schultz-against-the-hecklers) as an Independent, [called](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/29/schultz-warren-tax-plan-2020-1133228) the Warren plan “ridiculous.” On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, Mitch McConnell and two other Republican senators said that they would [introduce](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/01/28/top-gop-senators-propose-repealing-estate-tax-which-is-expected-be-paid-by-fewer-than-americans-year/) a bill to repeal the federal estate tax, a type of wealth tax that has already been so weakened that it now hits fewer than two thousand families a year. So much for billionaires and Republicans. \n\nBut many moderate and progressive Democrats, far from recoiling from the Warren proposal, enthusiastically embraced it. “Wealth inequality in our nation is a national scandal,” Gene Sperling, a veteran Democratic policy wonk who served as a top economic adviser to Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, [wrote](https://twitter.com/genebsperling/status/1088544770706726912) on Twitter. “This type of wealth tax that [@SenWarren](https://twitter.com/SenWarren) is proposing is essential. It frees up dramatic amounts of resources that make it more likely the vast number Americans can have economic security & a shot at their own small nest egg.” \n\nSince the publication of “Top Heavy,” the share of income and wealth going to the top one per cent, and especially the top 0\\.1 per cent, has risen a good deal further, while the wages and incomes of regular American households have stagnated. Meanwhile, the Citizens United ruling, the rise of super *PAC*{:.small}s, and the lurch to the right of the Republican Party and, of course, the Trump Presidency have demonstrated the growing political power of the billionaire class, throwing into sharper relief Wolff’s point that “the current tax system in the United States leaves these vast differences in wealth and power largely untouched.” Seth Hanlon, another former economic aide to Obama, who is now a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, told me, “It is essential that we do something bold to get at our tax code’s failure to tax major accumulations of wealth. It is terrific that she”—Warren—“has put it on the table.”\n\nIn many policy circles, where taxing wealth is widely seen as an idea whose time has come, the debate is shifting to practicalities. Bill Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who worked at the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President George H. W. Bush, told me that taxing wealth more effectively can be justified on at least four different grounds: equity (in some cases, as Warren Buffett famously pointed out, the very richest American households pay a smaller share of their income in tax than middle-income households do); revenues (even though the unemployment rate is at a historic low, the budget deficit stands at more than 4\\.5 per cent of G.D.P.); “rent-seeking” (by manipulating compensation committees, many C.E.O.s effectively set their own compensation); and the desire to prevent the further emergence of a plutocracy. (By some estimates, the top 0\\.1 per cent now controls almost as much wealth as the bottom ninety per cent of households.) “I am sympathetic to the idea of a wealth tax,” Gale said. “It is certainly not a crazy notion, but I don’t know if it would work.”\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nPart of the problem is that other countries have shown that wealth taxes create incentives for rich people to evade them by sheltering or hiding assets, or, in extremis, by emigrating. France and Denmark both got rid of wealth taxes on investments and other non-property assets, partly because they didn’t raise as much money as was hoped. Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez, two Berkeley economists who provided a detailed assessment of the Warren tax plan, estimate it would raise $2\\.75 trillion over ten years, which is a very large sum. But Wojciech Kopczuk, an economist at Columbia University who has studied the estate tax extensively, told me that the $2\\.75 trillion figure is “wildly optimistic.” If Warren’s tax were enacted, Kopczuk said, many wealthy families would divide their wealth among themselves to stay under the fifty-million-dollar threshold, and they would also start shifting their wealth into assets that are hard to value, such as collectibles and privately held businesses. “I think that they”—Saez and Zucman—“are assuming that there is more wealth than there is, and they are underestimating the amount of tax planning that will take place,” Kopczuk said. “I am sure that the tax lawyers and tax accountants have ideas already.”\n\nEconomists who have looked into tax avoidance have reached differing conclusions. A recent study of Switzerland, which has long administered a wealth tax at the level of individual cantons, found that a “0\\.1 percentage-point increase in wealth taxes leads to 3.4% lower wealth holdings in the cross canton data.” That’s a big impact. “When you tax people’s wealth, they manage to somehow reduce their taxable wealth,” Jonathan Gruber, an M.I.T. economist who was one of the authors of the study, [told](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/elizabeth-warren-s-plan-tax-super-rich-has-been-tried-n963971) NBC News. “We don’t know if it’s by saving less or by hiding it.” Gruber added, “Elizabeth Warren’s tax would raise money, it’s a question of how much.”\n\nGiven the practical challenges involved in taxing wealth directly, some economists, Kopczuk included, favor an alternative approach of reforming two existing taxes: the capital-gains tax and the estate tax. At the moment, many rich people largely avoid the capital-gains tax by holding on to their appreciated assets until they die, and then passing them on to their heirs, whose liability is greatly reduced because of a loophole in the tax code known as a “step-up in basis.” Moreover, the top rate of capital-gains tax has been reduced over the years. It is currently at 23\\.9 per cent, which is a lot lower than the top rate of income tax.\n\nIn theory, there is nothing to prevent Congress from abolishing the “step-up in basis” loophole and raising the capital-gains tax rate. In 2016, the Obama Administration suggested doing both of these things, but the Republicans who controlled Congress ignored the proposal. Theoretically, we could go even further in this direction, forcing taxpayers to declare their over-all wealth every year on the basis of market prices, and making them pay the capital-gains tax on any increase over the previous year. “That’s the obvious thing to do,” Kopczuk said. “You can go much further in the direction of taxing wealth accruals on an annual basis, compared to what we are doing now.”\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAs the election campaign moves along, critics of Warren’s proposal are sure to repeat these types of arguments. But the designers and supporters of the Warren plan have already anticipated many of them, including the issue of tax evasion and avoidance. In their [written assessment](http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/saez-zucman-wealthtax-warren.pdf) of the Warren proposal, Saez and Zucman assume that “households subject to the wealth tax are able to reduce their reported net worth by 15% through a combination of tax evasion and tax avoidance.” The $2.75 trillion revenue projection takes this level of evasion into account. \n\nSaez and Zucman didn’t pluck the fifteen-per-cent estimate from thin air. They obtained it by averaging the results of four academic studies of wealth taxation, in Colombia, Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland. In their written assessment, Saez and Zucman raise some technical questions about the study in Switzerland, which contained a much higher estimate for tax evasion than the other three countries. “Switzerland has no systematic third party reporting of assets,” the authors noted, “which can&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;make tax evasion responses larger than in Scandinavia.” When I spoke with Zucman on Wednesday, he argued that the fifteen-per-cent estimate for tax avoidance in the case of the Warren wealth tax could well be too high, because the European wealth taxes weren’t directly comparable to the U.S. “They had all sorts of exemptions and loopholes for certain types of assets, which is what makes tax avoidance possible and incentivizes it,” Zucman said. “The lesson we draw is that for a wealth tax to work well, it has to be comprehensive. In the case of the Warren wealth tax, it is very clear that there are no exemptions whatsoever. That is why we are confident in our scoring.” \n\nIn their assessment, Saez and Zucman also pointed out that the Warren tax plan would be “well enforced through a combination of systematic third party reporting and audits.” The proposal features a “significant increase” in the enforcement budget for the I.R.S. and a minimum audit rate for households subject to the new levy. To deter the ultra-rich from fleeing to countries without a wealth tax, it also includes a punitive “exit tax” of forty per cent on “the net worth above $50 million of any U.S. citizen who renounces their citizenship.” Tax avoidance “is not something that happens out of the blue,” Zucman said. “It is something that policymakers can encourage or discourage.” \n\nIn fact, some important preventive steps have already been taken, particularly relating to the use of offshore tax havens. Not very long ago, rich people could simply set up bank or brokerage accounts in places like the Bahamas, Panama, and Switzerland, secure in the knowledge that they would be beyond the reach of the I.R.S. But, since the [passage](https://itep.org/foreign-account-tax-compliance-act-fatca-a-critical-anti-tax-evasion-tool/) of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (*FATCA*{: .small}), in 2014, foreign financial institutions are legally obligated to identify accounts held by U.S. citizens and report details about them to the I.R.S.; failure to do so can lead to heavy fines. The enactment of *FATCA*{: .small} has “dramatically improved our ability to uncover hidden, offshore accounts,” Lily Batchelder, a law professor at N.Y.U. who previously worked in the Obama White House and as the chief tax counsel to the Senate Finance Committee, [pointed out](https://twitter.com/lilybatch/status/1088575804777381889) on Twitter.\n\nIt’s also worth remembering that eliminating evasion completely is an unrealistic goal for any tax. Bill Gale pointed me to estimates from the I.R.S. that the rate of evasion of the income tax is sixteen per cent, and the rate of evasion from taxes on sole proprietor businesses is sixty-four per cent. “The fact that there is some evidence of evasion doesn’t make a wealth tax any different from any other tax,” Gale said. The issue is whether evasion and avoidance can be held to a reasonable level. With a comprehensive base and a rigorous system of enforcement, the Warren tax may well meet that standard.\n\nIn any case, alternative approaches to taxing wealth, such as taxing annual accruals, would face similar challenges. If we adopted this model rich taxpayers would still have to declare the total value of their assets to the I.R.S. To make the system work, there would need to be third-party appraisals and regular audits.\n\nAnother important issue is whether relying on enhanced capital-gains taxes could match the revenues from Warren’s tax. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the Obama proposal to eliminate the step-up in basis and raise the capital-gains tax rate would have raised about two hundred and forty billion dollars over ten years; that’s less than a tenth of the $2\\.75 trillion figure that Saez and Zucman project. Levying an annual capital-gains tax on accruals rather than on actual asset sales would certainly increase the revenue yields, but by how much? Zucman pointed out that the revenues would be volatile, because they would vary with asset prices, and no other country has shifted to this type of system, so it is hard to know how it would work out. “To me, it sounds like more of a pipe dream,” he said.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nEdward Wolff, who a quarter of a century ago saw his wealth-tax proposal go nowhere, and who in 2017 published a monumental [historical study](https://www.amazon.com/Century-Wealth-America-Professor-Edward/dp/0674495144) of wealth in the United States, is watching the current debate with a combination of wry amusement and encouragement. During our conversation, he pointed out that there isn’t any reason why some version of the Warren proposal couldn’t be combined with other proposals being canvassed, such as reforming the capital-gains tax and the estate tax, and raising the top rate of income tax—as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has advocated. “From the point of view of fairness, you want to tax people based on their ability to pay,” he said. “Income itself doesn’t give you a good indicator of ability to pay. Some combination of income and wealth is better.” Zucman agrees. “The ideal tax system would have a progressive income tax, a progressive estate tax, and a progressive annual tax on wealth,” he said. “They all do different things, and they complement each other.” ","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c774a08312cd3aa6c36","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Elizabeth Warren","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"elizabeth-warren"},{"id":"5c2e1ed62bfcc72cd92d073e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Wealth Disparity","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"wealth-disparity"},{"id":"5c2e3095397f5b30646d0a59","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Capital Gains","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"capital-gains"},{"id":"5c2e2094425c632c6cd708bb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tax","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tax"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909e8fb8b51cf59fc4246ae","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1995.

The other takeaway, a more encouraging one, is that Trump is also just a regular politician, subject to the normal laws of political gravity.\n\nSpeaking in the White House Rose Garden on Friday afternoon, the President said he would sign a temporary spending bill, which will enable shuttered federal agencies to reopen and allow about eight hundred thousand federal employees to start receiving back pay for the wages they have missed out on. He also expressed confidence that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill would use the three weeks to reach a “fair deal” on additional spending for border security. And he claimed that the Democrats had “finally and fully acknowledged that having a barrier, a fence, a wall, or whatever you call it, will be an important part of the solution.”\n\nThe Democrats haven’t acknowledged anything of the sort. Earlier in the week, House Democrats indicated that, if the President agreed to reopen the government, they would support a $5.7-billion spending package—matching Trump’s figure—for over-all border security. They also made clear that this package wouldn’t include any money for a wall. With his poll ratings falling and some key Republican senators threatening to abandon the White House, Trump did what any other President who had dug himself into such a hole would do: he capitulated and tried to put a positive spin on things. But the lengthy, campaign-style speech that he delivered didn’t fool anybody on either side of the political divide. “This is the first time I’ve ever seen a President go to the Rose Garden and take a defeat lap,” the Democratic congressman Dan Kildee, the chief deputy whip, said, on CNN. Jonathan Swan, Axios’s White House correspondent, tweeted, “A former White House official texts me, unsolicited: ‘Trump looks pathetic...he just ceded his presidency to Nancy Pelosi.’”\n\nThat was going too far. Trump is still the President, and, at the end of his speech, he repeated his threat to use his Presidential powers to declare a national emergency if he doesn’t get what he wants out of the upcoming negotiations. But, whatever happens next, he’s just learned a pair of harsh lessons: how futile government shutdowns are, and how constricted Presidential power is when the opposition party controls at least one house of Congress. In the modern era, divided government has become the norm in Washington. At some point in their Presidencies, Trump’s four most recent predecessors—George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama—had to learn how to deal with it. Now it is Trump’s turn. In the words of Robert Reich, a former Labor Secretary in the Clinton Administration, “Nancy Pelosi just showed that Congress remains a coequal branch of government, despite Trump’s refusal to accept the limitations of his own power.”\n\nThe President can’t say he wasn’t warned about the risks he was taking. Back before Christmas, when he started the shutdown and indicated that he was prepared for it to be an extended one, he was apparently working on the theory that the longer it lasted, the more leverage he would have in his campaign to get the funding for his beloved border wall. Practically everybody else in Washington, including Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, and Paul Ryan, the departing House Speaker, believed the political dynamic would work in the opposite direction—the longer the shutdown went on, the more angry the public would get, and the more pressure there would be for the President and his party to cave. Of course, he could try to blame Democratic obstructionism, but that was always going to be difficult, especially since he had preëmptively seized ownership of the shutdown during an Oval Office meeting with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.\n\nAccording to reports, McConnell and Ryan both advised Trump not to take the plunge. He ignored the advice, as he is apt to do. And, of course, the wizened old pols turned out to be right. As a two-week shutdown turned into a three-week shutdown, then a four-week shutdown, then a five-week shutdown, stories emerged of federal employees attending food banks and being unable to afford their chemotherapy sessions. Public opinion turned sharply against the President. By Friday morning, even Christopher Wray, the man Trump appointed to lead the F.B.I. after he fired James Comey, had had enough. “Making some people stay home when they don’t want to, and making others show up without pay, it’s mind-boggling, it’s shortsighted, and it’s unfair,” Wray said, in a video message to the Bureau’s thirty-five thousand employees, many of whom were working without pay. “It takes a lot to get me angry, but I’m about as angry as I’ve been in a long, long time.”\n\nBy that stage, Trump had already accepted the inevitable and decided to sue for peace. This was all but confirmed on Wednesday, when Pelosi refused to allow the President to deliver this year’s State of the Union address from the House chamber; rather than going into a rage, Trump responded more or less politely. At that point, McConnell, who had remained above the fray for weeks, reëngaged. The same night, Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, floated the idea of using a temporary spending resolution to reopen the government and allow time for further negotiations on some sort of border-security package, even with no guarantees of any money for the wall.\n\nEven though the President had stated repeatedly that he wouldn’t open the government until he received adequate funding for his wall, this was the deal that he ended up accepting. Once he made the announcement, it didn’t take long for the darts to start flying in from right field, including this one, from the columnist Ann Coulter, who was one of the people who encouraged him to start the shutdown in the first place: “Good news for George Herbert Walker Bush: As of today, he is no longer the biggest wimp ever to serve as President of the United States.” ","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c8b2bc86f2c9a2449bd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Nancy Pelosi","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"nancy-pelosi"},{"id":"5c2e1c7a41e4c73c088d7755","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Government Shutdown","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"government-shutdown"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909e8fb8b51cf59fc4246ae","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1995.
