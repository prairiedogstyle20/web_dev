        an illegal alien has been arrested for the murder of Rocky Paul Jones, 
        51, of Visalia, California.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Garcia was caught on store video 
        confronting Jones in a convenience store parking lot at 2:30a.m on 
        December 16, 2018. Garcia is then alleged to have shot and killed Jones.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        That night Garcia also reportedly is believed to be involved in multiple 
        shootings, including the shooting of a farm worker,&nbsp; and robbery of 
        a gas station in another town.<br>
        <br>
        Garcia is alleged to have a criminal record dating back to 2002 and 
        apparently ordered to be deported in 2014 and had past multiple 
        immigration holds.<br>
        <br>
        Some in law enforcement have pointed out that the State of California's 
        controversial passage of Senate Bill 54, also knows as California's 
        illegal alien &quot;sanctuary&quot; law in 2017, is the reason Garcia was allowed 
        to remain in the US and go on his crime spree and kill Mr. Jones.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Jones was a dairyman who was 
        born in Tulare California. He is survived by his daughter, brothers, 
        stepfather, and nieces ands nephews.&nbsp; Family members said Rocky was 
        a &quot;loving and genuine&quot; person.</font></p>

        an illegal alien from Mexico, was arrested in the murder and 
        dismembering of his neighbor Robert Page, 76, of Morrow, Georgia.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFCC">Page's wife contacted police on 
        November 8, 2018 to report her senior citizen husband missing.&nbsp; A 
        trail of blood led police to an adjacent home where Ponce-Martinez was 
        renting a room.&nbsp; At that home, investigators found bloody pieces of 
        a body hidden in a cooler and under a tarp, which were determined to 
        belong to&nbsp; Mr. Page. <br>
        <br>
        Police found Ponce-Martinez hiding under a piece of furniture on the 
        property.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFCC">A news report indicated that 
        security video showed Ponce-Martinez on Page's property prior&nbsp; to 
        Mr. Page's murder and said that the two men may have been arguing&nbsp; 
        before the murder.</font></p>

        reportedly moved to Morrow Georgia just 3 months earlier, has been 
        charged with&nbsp; murder.&nbsp; Although Ponce-Martinez had just moved 
        next to the Page family recently, Ponce-Martinez had been caught by the 
        US Border Patrol attempting to illegally enter the US once before in 
        2015.&nbsp; </font></p>

        on November 18, 2006.<br>
        <br>
        The Louisiana State Police believe that Chacon was driving the truck 
        that crashed head-on into Zieto's motorcycle in Denham Springs, LA.&nbsp; 
        The State Police told reporters that&nbsp; Chacon fled the scene of the 
        accident, leaving the badly injured 20-year-old to die in the street.&nbsp; 
        Zieto's injuries were so severe, he died on the way to the hospital.<br>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">According to a WAFB TV-9 news 
        report, &quot;Chacon is wanted for negligent homicide, failure to yield, 
        hit-and-run and operating a vehicle without legal presence.&quot;</p>

        <p align="left">Judy Zieto, Blake Zieto's mother, claims that Chacon was 
        not only in the U.S. illegally, he also had a criminal record and was 
        awaiting a deportation hearing.&nbsp; Mrs. Zieto has been pursuing 
        prosecution of Chacon since her son's death in 2006. </p>

        has been arrested for the brutal murder 
        of Iowan native Mollie Tibbitts, 20.&nbsp; Authorities have determined 
        that Rivera, a Mexican national, is an illegal alien and has been living 
        and working illegally in the US for several years.<br>
        <br>
        Investigators believe that Ms. Tibbitts, a sophomore at the University of 
        Iowa, encountered Rivera in July while 
        she went running on July 18th in her rural Brooklyn, Iowa neighborhood.&nbsp; Ms. Tibbits never 
        returned home from her run.  She was reported missing and law enforcement began searching for the missing woman.

        <p align="left"><span style="background-color: #000000">
        <font color="#FFFFFF">Rivera was identified as a suspect thanks to 
        security camera video captured him following Ms. Tibbits.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Rivewra reportedly confessed to the murder of Ms. Tibbitts after getting 
        angry after she rebuffed his advances and threatened to call police.<br>
        <br>
        Rivera&nbsp; led law enforcement agents to a field where he claimed he 
        put Ms. Tibbits body.&nbsp; A body was 
        found at that location but it has not officially been confirmed to be Ms. Tibbitts.<br>
        <br>
        Rivera has been charged with first-degree murder.&nbsp; Conflicting 
        reports have bail set at&nbsp; $1-5 million.<br>

        <font color="#FFFFFF">Russian national Igor Zubko admitted to the murder 
        of Shayley Estes.&nbsp; He accepted a&nbsp; plea deal in which he will 
        serve a life sentence in prison, which allowed him to avoid a possible 
        death sentence conviction.&nbsp; Original entry below:</font></span></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FF0000"><b>Igor Zubko, </b></font><font color="#FFFFFF">
        26,&nbsp;a Russian&nbsp; illegal alien was arrested for the&nbsp; brutal&nbsp; murder of 
        Shayley Estes, 22, who was found dead in her Phoenix, Arizona&nbsp; home 
        on July 24, 2015.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">
        &nbsp;Police caught Zubko at the Sky Harbor International Airport before 
        he could flee on a flight to San Francisco, California. [OJJPAC note: 
        San Francisco's extreme sanctuary policy protects criminal aliens from 
        federal detention and deportation.]</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Zubko was&nbsp; charged with&nbsp; 
        first-degree murder, kidnapping, among other criminal offenses. </font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">The victim, whom&nbsp; had 
        befriended Zubko several months earlier,&nbsp; had allowed Zubko to move 
        into her home.&nbsp; However, according to the victim's mother, the 
        Russian national began threatening her daughter, so Shayley obtained a 
        restraining order against Zubko.&nbsp; One news report stated that the 
        order was served on Zubko on July 14, 2015, and death threats from Zubko 
        followed.<br>
        <br>
        The&nbsp; restraining order served on Zubko on or about July 14, 2015, 
        did not deter Zubko.&nbsp; Zubko reportedly told police that he bought a 
        gun, entered the victim's home using a house key he had retained,&nbsp; 
        and shot Estes on July 24th.&nbsp; Zubko alleged that the shooting was 
        an accident, a story police and prosecutors didn't believe--concluding 
        that the young woman was shot after attempting to flee Zubko.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Prior to her murder, Shayley was 
        working a full-time job and also attending college where she was 
        studying chemistry.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">The Estes family has been 
        devastated by the loss of Shayley.&nbsp; Shannon Estes, Shayley's 
        broken-hearted mother, wrote that her daughter was her best friend.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Shayley is also survived by 4 loving brothers and a nephew, all whom she 
        also loved very much.<br>
        <br>
        Shannon Estes wrote that Zubko enter the U.S. legally but overstayed his 
        visa, and remained in the U.S. illegally.&nbsp; The judge in the case 
        set Zubko's bond&nbsp; at $1 million dollars.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFCC">Martinez-Ramirez reportedly had 
        prior assault and drug convictions. The Santa Maria P.D. had previously 
        arrested him 6 times. He was arrested just one week prior to the Pharis 
        attack on weapons and drug charges, and was released from jail 96 hours 
        prior to breaking into Pharis' home.&nbsp; Because California&nbsp; 
        prosecutors were reducing&nbsp; his criminal charges from felonies to 
        misdemeanors, Martinez-Ramirez was able to avoid being turned over to 
        federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and placed into 
        deportation proceedings. <br>
        <br>
        Ms. Pharis was a veteran and later employed at the Vandenberg Air Force 
        Base prior to her murder.&nbsp; Friends said outside work, she was 
        involved in charity work,&nbsp; rescuing animals, and had been planning 
        a trip to Denmark.</font></p>

        I put Santa Maria, CA on the OJJPAC illegal alien Sanctuary Cities List, 
        USA (before Pharis's murder), the city had sent me a letter threatening 
        legal action if I didn't remove the City of Santa Maria off my list.&nbsp; 
        I did not remove it and continued to pressure the city to end its 
        protection of illegal aliens.&nbsp; Unfortunately it was not enough to 
        save the life of Ms. Pharis. -Steve Salvi, Founder, OJJPAC.org</font></p>

        Cory Wride of the Utah County Sheriff's Office and seriously wounded 
        another officer.<br>
        <br>
        Sergeant Wride was shot and killed while checking on a vehicle in which 
        Jauregui and his 17-year-old accomplice occupied.<br>
        <br>
        It is believed that&nbsp; Jauregui used a rifle to opened fire on Wride 
        as he pulled behind Jauregui's vehicle, killing Wride before he exited 
        his&nbsp; patrol car.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Before Sergeant&nbsp; Wride was 
        killed, he relayed a description of the assailant's&nbsp; vehicle to a&nbsp; 
        department dispatcher.&nbsp; Another sheriff's deputy was then able to 
        identify Jaurengui's vehicle and continue the pursuit.&nbsp; However, 
        that officer was also shot in the head by Jauregui.&nbsp; (That officer 
        survived his head wound.)<br>
        <br>
        Jauregui continued to flee by carjacking a vehicle until that vehicle&nbsp; 
        crashed after a pursuit and shoot-out with officers from the Juab County 
        Sheriff's Department.&nbsp; Jauregui was wounded and taken to a hospital 
        where he later died.<br>
        <br>
        Megan Grunwald, Jaurengui's&nbsp; 17-year-old girlfriend and accomplice 
        was arrested, charged, and convicted for her role in the duo's crime 
        spree.&nbsp; She was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison.<br>

        implication in the November 17, 2001 death of Dennielle &quot;Nikki&quot; 
        Schermock, 25.<br>
        <br>
        According to Vickie Lyon, the victim's mother,&nbsp; Fernado Reyes was high on 
        cocaine and intoxicated and was driving in the wrong direction on 
        Poinciana Boulevard.&nbsp; Reyes pickup truck smashed head-on into&nbsp; Ms. Schermock 
        1988 Toyota.&nbsp; The crash instantly killed the young mother.&nbsp; Ms. Schermock's 
        two young children, Brieanna, 4, and 
        16-months-old Brandon were also in their mother's car.&nbsp; The 
        4-year-old sustained&nbsp; serious injuries too but paramedics&nbsp; 
        were able to revive her at the crash scene.&nbsp; Schermock's toddler 
        was in a car-seat that Lyon said saved the young boy's life, despite 
        various skin abrasions.&nbsp; Both children were life-flighted to an 
        Orlando, FL Trauma Center, where Lyon's granddaughter underwent 
        emergency surgery.<br>
        <br>
        Vickie Lyon then has the horrible task of going to the local morgue to 
        identify her daughter's violently broken body--a task that is every 
        parents worst nightmare--and an experience that haunts Ms. Lyon to this 
        day.<br>
        <br>
        Fernado Reyes was treated at an Orlando Medical Center and then at a 
        rehabilitation center.&nbsp; Lyon&nbsp; says that Reyes's family &quot;snuck 
        him out in the middle of the night&quot; [of the rehab center] and Reyes has 
        been a missing fugitive from justice ever since. </font></span></p>

        <p align="left"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF">
        Lyon believes that Reyes was basically &quot;allowed&quot; to escape.&nbsp; She 
        believes that&nbsp; the Florida Highway Patrol and the State of 
        Florida's lax investigation and control over Reyes was purposeful 
        because they didn't want to deal with the sticky issue of&nbsp; his 
        illegal immigration status and Mexican authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &quot;It was like dealing with the Keystone Cops&quot; said Lyon.</font></span></p>

        However, the FBI intervened and had the immigration hold removed because

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF99">While thousands of American families are being&nbsp; injured, 
        maimed and killed every year, the  Obama administration 
        continues its unconstitutional&nbsp; immigration policies and neutering 
        of all enforcment programs previously available to enforce U.S. 
        Immigration laws.&nbsp; The Obama administration's actions are&nbsp; 
        directly responsible for Barry's death.&nbsp; Under the Obama 
        administration's enforcement protocols, illegal aliens can basically 
        violate our immigration laws with impunity until public outrage forces 
        it to act.&nbsp; </font><font size="3" color="#FFFF99">It took Bob Barry, 
        Jr.'s death for 
        the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE)&nbsp; to place an immigration hold  on Gutierrez, 
        even though he was a repeat offender.&nbsp; Some cities and counties in 
        the U.S. even protect illegal aliens by passing &quot;sanctuary&quot; policies 
        that prohibit local law enforcement from honoring&nbsp; federal&nbsp; 
        immigration hold requests.&nbsp; Some of these cities and counties also 
        help the Mexican government by accepting and allowing the distribution 
        of&nbsp; Matricula ID cards as valid ID, which they are not.&nbsp; I 
        suspect this is what Gutierrez presented as ID to Oklahoma law 
        enforcement. </font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFF99">Like many other illegal 
        aliens, Gutierrez has&nbsp; been 
        caught&nbsp; entering the U.S.&nbsp;illegally on multiple occasions.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        US Border Patrol agents had captured Gutierrez three times prior to killing 
        Barry.&nbsp; How did Gutierrez avoid a felony charge of&nbsp; illegal&nbsp; 
        reentry before he even had a chance to kill Barry?&nbsp; 
        Gutierrez apparently&nbsp; benefited from the Obama administration's &quot;illegal alien catch and release policy.&quot;&nbsp; 
        Gutierrez reportedly was &quot;voluntarily&quot; returned to Mexico two times in 
        2010 and once in 2013.&nbsp; Gutierrez's voluntary removal allowed him 
        to avoid prosecution which might have deterred 
        him from returning to the U.S. again, keeping&nbsp; him out of the path 
        of Bob Barry, Jr's motorcycle of that fateful day, June 20, 2015.</font></p>

        Roberto Galo</font></b><font color="#FFFF99">, a Honduran alien living 
        illegally in the U.S., was finally taken into custody by Immigration and Customs 
        Enforcement (ICE) in January, 2013.&nbsp; Galo had been previously 
        convicted in the November 2010 vehicular death of 
        Drew Rosenberg of San Francisco.&nbsp; According to Don Rosenberg, 
        Drew's father, Gallo's punishment was a 6-month jail sentence in which 
        Galo actually only had to serve 43 days behind bars.&nbsp; Galo was 
        freed and released back into the community by September, 2012.&nbsp; If not for the Rosenberg's 
        family's activism and insistence that Galo be taken into custody by 
         
        ICE in 2013, Galo might have remained free and continued to be a threat 
        to public safety.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Galo, an unlicensed 
        driver,&nbsp; illegally crossed into the path of 
        Rosenberg's&nbsp; motorcycle causing a crash.&nbsp; Galo&nbsp; then drove 
        back and forth over Drew Rosenber's body 3 times.&nbsp; Rosenberg was taken to the hospital but died 
        from his injuries.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Months earlier, Galo had been 
        previously cited and had his car impounded for driving unlicensed and 
        driving the wrong way down a one-way street.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Although Galo was in the U.S. 
        illegally, the federal government&nbsp; granted&nbsp;Galo 
        Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in 2000&nbsp; prior to Rosenberg's 
        death due to conditions in his native Honduras.&nbsp; </font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">But after Rosenberg's death, Galo no longer 
        qualified for TPS protection.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">However, under the Obama 
        administration's prosecutorial discretion policies, vehicular 
        manslaughter and driving without a license, are not considered&nbsp; 
        serious enough offenses to begin deportation proceedings.&nbsp; </font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Police allege that Guaman was 
        intoxicated and unlicensed when he&nbsp; failed to stop at a stop sign.&nbsp; 
        Guaman reportedly ran the stop sign in his brother's 2004 Ford Pickup hitting Matthew Denice's&nbsp; 
        motorcycle. </font></p>

        mile, then after Denice was thrown&nbsp; from beneath Guaman's truck, 
        Guaman backed over his body and then left the scene of the accident 
        (like most cowardly and uncaring illegal aliens).&nbsp; </font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">After police stopped Gauman, 
        his 6-year-old son&nbsp; exited the truck and attacked police.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Since 2007, Gauman has reportedly 
        been arrested three times for driving without a license, assault and 
        battery on a police officer, and an assault on a fireman.&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Guaman is currently being 
        held on a $100,000 bond and has a court appointed lawyer.&nbsp; The 
        Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
        Agency has placed an immigration hold on Guaman in 
        case he attempts to post bond.&nbsp; </font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Matthew was responsible and funny 
        young man. Before Matthew was killed, he had just recently graduated 
        college and was working as an IT consultant.&nbsp; He had a longtime 
        girlfriend and many friends.&nbsp; Since Matthew was murdered by a drunk 
        driver,&nbsp; it's ironic that Matthew&nbsp; had made a pact not to 
        drink alcohol until he was 21, and on many occasions gave friends who 
        did drink rides home to ensure their safety as well as the safety of 
        others.&nbsp; Not&nbsp; surprisingly, he was voted &quot;most dependable&quot; at 
        his high school.&nbsp; His family and friends miss his presence.&nbsp; 
        Their world changed forever on that tragic day.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3" color="#FF0000">[OJJPAC note:&nbsp; Like 
        so many other cases, Gauman had been cited for driving without a license 
        and committed other violent crimes but evidently was not&nbsp; turned over to Homeland 
        Security for deportation.&nbsp; Now a son of America is dead and his 
        family must&nbsp; bear the cost of our government's failure to secure 
        our nation's borders because Obama&nbsp; and other politicians pander to 
        Hispanic lobby groups and U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who oppose enforcement of U.S. immigration laws.]</font></p>

        mother, Andrea Maddox.&nbsp; Andrea Maddox and her daughter were
        crossing a street when they were hit by Rodriguez. who has
        been hired [illegally] by a waterproofing company in Oak Creek.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Rodriguez had been charged with
        causing a death and driving with a revoked license. [Unfortunately it
        appears that like in Ohio, the crime is a misdemeanor, with a maximum sentence
        is less than one year for illegals who kill Americans].&nbsp; Now
        convicted, the judge sentenced Rodriguez to
        nine months, the maximum sentence for causing death while driving with a
        revoked license.<br>
        <br>
        The family is angry that Rodriguez could get such a light sentence for
        killing their 6-year-old daughter.<br>
        <br>
        It was reported that U.S.
        Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported Rodriguez last
        February but&nbsp; Rodriguez once again&nbsp; illegally re-entering the
        U.S. thanks to poor border enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rodriguez now faces
        federal charges for re-entering the country illegally.&nbsp; The federal
        penalties could land Rodriguez in prison for up to 20 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">News reports have indicated that
        police records show that Rodriguez has been convicted&nbsp; and served
        time in jail before for driving while intoxicated.&nbsp; He has been
        found guilty for other traffic offenses including speeding, a traffic
        sign violation, and accidents causing property damage.</font></p>

      hurt my Daddy and now my Daddy is dead. I was very sad and I cried and
      cried and then I asked a lot of questions. I asked my Mommy how the bad
      man hurt Daddy. She said he shot him with a gun. I wanted to know why my
      Mommy couldnt fix it since she was a nurse. Im very angry at the bad
      man who hurt my Daddy because he hurt my Daddy really bad. I will never be
      happy with the bad man. After Mommy told me, I made Daddy pictures and
      cards. Mommy tied them to balloons and we went outside and let them go to
      heaven where my Daddy is. I said Daddy, I hope you like the cards and
      pictures, I miss you. Then I saw Daddy on TV and I was very proud. Grandma
      Gwen told me he was on TV because he was special and was a hero. My Daddy
      is in heaven because hes a good man. My Aunt Jamie told me only good
      people can go to heaven and my Daddy cant hurt anymore. I asked how she
      knew that and my Aunt Jamie said because theres an angel at the gates
      of Heaven and he only lets good people in. I miss my Daddy very much and I
      will always remember him and love him.</font></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">Over ten years ago Billy and Kathy Inman of Woodstock, GA, 
      were taking their only child, then 16-year-old son Dustin on a fishing 
      trip in their new Pontiac Grand Am just days before Father's Day.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">While the Inmans were stopped at a traffic light in 
      Gilmer County, Georgia, their vehicle was rear ended by Gonzalo 
      Harrell-Gonzalez, an illegal alien from Mexico.&nbsp; Gonzalez told police that 
      he fell asleep at the wheel.&nbsp; The impact of the 60mph high-speed crash 
      left Gonzalez with minor injuries and the Inman family forever physically 
      and emotionally shattered.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Dustin Inman, who just turned 16-years-old and was to 
      enter the 10<sup>th</sup> grade at Etowah High School, died at the scene. 
      &nbsp;There would be no more cherished father and son fishing and hunting 
      trips.&nbsp; No need for dad to continue to teach his son how to drive.&nbsp; 
      No more Mother's Day or Father's Day cards from Dustin.&nbsp; Dustin was 
      gone--forever.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Dustins parents, Billy and Kathy Inman, suffered injuries so severe 
      that they both had to be life-flighted to an Atlanta hospital.</p>
