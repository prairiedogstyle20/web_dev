paywall drop-cap" data-reactid="228"><p data-reactid="229">As much as Democrats were appalled by <strong>Ilhan Omar&#x2019;s</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/opinion/ilhan-omar-antisemitism.html">very bad tweets</a>, the outrage cycle was hijacked by the staggering chutzpah of <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/donald-trump#intcid=dt-hot-link">Donald Trump</a>.</strong> &#x201C;Trump calling on a member to resign for having said offensive things&#x2014;that is beyond parody,&#x201D; a Democratic House aide told me Tuesday, shortly after the president said Omar should call it quits over a series of controversial social-media posts that were widely criticized as anti-Semitic. &#x201C;This is a president who said neo-Nazis were &#x2018;very fine people&#x2019; and stood by <strong>Steve King&#x2019;s</strong> bigotry,&#x201D; said a senior staffer to a Democrat on the committee. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s no reason anyone should take him seriously when it comes to denouncing hate.&#x201D;</p><!-- react-empty: 230 --><p data-reactid="231">Omar, a hijabi Muslim who has been fiercely critical of Israel, was already a prime target for the right after a <a href="https://twitter.com/ilhanmn/status/269488770066313216">2012 tweet</a> surfaced, in which Omar said, &#x201C;Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.&#x201D; The Minnesota congresswoman apologized last month, but set off the anti-Semitism tripwire again on Sunday when she invoked the late-90s hip-hop anthem &#x201C;It&#x2019;s All About the Benjamins&#x201D; to imply that pro-Israel members of Congress are beholden to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the powerful pro-Israel lobbying group. This time, the outcry wasn&#x2019;t just from the right: Democratic leadership issued a swift and stinging rebuke, condemning Omar&#x2019;s use of &#x201C;anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel&#x2019;s supporters&#x201D; as &#x201C;deeply offensive.&#x201D; On Monday afternoon, Omar issued a statement in which she &#x201C;unequivocally&#x201D; apologized, even as she reaffirmed the &#x201C;problematic role of lobbyists in our politics.&#x201D;</p><!-- react-empty: 232 --><!-- react-empty: 233 --><p data-reactid="234">Largely satisfied with Omar&#x2019;s mea culpa, Democrats want to forgive and forget. &#x201C;It was a mistake. She apologized,&#x201D; explained the Democratic aide. &#x201C;Some people were more satisfied with her apology than others. But we can&#x2019;t waste days and weeks on this, because this is totally going to distract us from our agenda if we get hung up on this infighting.&#x201D; The tweet about AIPAC, this person said, was &#x201C;obviously a big self-inflicted wound, but we are not going to now look at the Republicans moving the goalposts and be responsive to them.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="235">Republicans, however, aren&#x2019;t ready to move on. Aboard Air Force One on Monday evening, Trump told reporters that Omar should &#x201C;be ashamed of herself.&#x201D; In the White House the following day, the president upped the ante. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s terrible what she said, and I think she should either resign from Congress, or she should certainly resign from the House Foreign Affairs Committee,&#x201D; Trump said. On Wednesday, Vice President <strong>Mike Pence</strong> followed his boss&#x2019;s lead and called on Omar to resign. &#x201C;At minimum,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;Democratic leaders should remove her from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="236">House Democratic leaders are not entertaining either idea. &#x201C;Ridiculous,&#x201D; a spokesperson for <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> told me Tuesday night. But after Trump helped paint the G.O.P. as the party of bigotry, Republicans seem eager to take a scalp of their own&#x2014;and drive a wedge through the Democratic ranks by turning some of the party&#x2019;s new rising stars into potent symbols of left-wing radicalism. &#x201C;Crazy to watch what House Dems are empowering/elevating,&#x201D; Congressman <strong>Lee Zeldin,</strong> who also sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, <a href="https://twitter.com/repleezeldin/status/1090390872867463177">wrote</a> on Twitter last month, taking aim at Omar. They have also targeted Michigan Congresswoman <strong>Rashida Tlaib,</strong> a Palestinian-American, who is also critical of Israel and, like Omar, supports the Palestinian-led B.D.S. movement, which Republicans have characterized as anti-Semitic. Minority Leader <strong>Kevin McCarthy,</strong> <strong>Paul Ryan&#x2019;s</strong> successor, has called on Pelosi to &#x201C;take action&#x201D; against Tlaib and Omar, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/mccarthy-gop-challenge-house-democrats-to-denounce-alleged-anti-semitism/2019/02/08/aef28514-2bae-11e9-b2fc-721718903bfc_story.html?utm_term=.1122797af106">equating</a> their policy views on Israel to Steve King&#x2019;s support for white supremacy.</p><p data-reactid="237">&#x201C;McCarthy and Lee Zeldin have been trying to stir the pot for a couple of weeks,&#x201D; the Democratic aide told me. &#x201C;We haven&#x2019;t really taken the bait.&#x201D; Party insiders are particularly irritated given Trump&#x2019;s own long history of trafficking in anti-Semitic tropes. While speaking at a forum hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition in December 2015, Trump said, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re not going to support me because I don&#x2019;t want your money . . . You want to control your own politician.&#x201D; In 2016, at the height of the presidential campaign, Trump&#x2014;whose daughter, <strong>Ivanka,</strong> and grandchildren are Jewish&#x2014;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/us/politics/trump-clinton-star-of-david.html">tweeted</a> an illustration of <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/hillary-clinton#intcid=dt-hot-link">Hillary Clinton</a></strong> surrounded by hundred-dollar bills and a Star of David shape with the words &#x201C;most corrupt candidate ever!&#x201D; McCarthy&#x2019;s hands aren&#x2019;t clean either: in a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/28/politics/tom-steyer-mccarthy-tweet/index.html">since-deleted tweet</a> from last October, the California congressman suggested that three Jewish billionaires&#x2014;<strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/george-soros#intcid=dt-hot-link">George Soros</a>,</strong> <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/tom-steyer#intcid=dt-hot-link">Tom Steyer</a>,</strong> and <strong>Michael Bloomberg</strong>&#x2014;were trying to &#x201C;buy&#x201D; the midterm elections.</p><p data-reactid="238">&#x201C;That is the exact same anti-Semitic trope that members denounced Congresswoman Omar for, and Kevin McCarthy has the nerve to say that trafficking in anti-Semitic tropes is all of a sudden unacceptable,&#x201D; the Democratic aide said. &#x201C;This is what their party has become. It is has become a den of conspiracy theorists and bigots and anti-Semites, or at least a place where anti-Semitic notions are not condemned and are given fertile ground.&#x201D; Omar&#x2019;s tweet crossed a line, Democrats say, but at least she apologized.</p><p data-reactid="239">Whether Republicans can accept that apology, too, remains to be seen. As partisanship deepens, both Republicans and Democrats are increasingly responding to racial and sexual issues in their own caucus by invoking the misdeeds of their colleagues across the aisle rather adjudicating them individually, on a moral level. It&#x2019;s not clarifying to compare Ilhan&#x2019;s comments to Trump&#x2019;s &#x201C;both sides&#x201D; equivocation, just as it&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/what-democrats-can-learn-from-their-virginia-racism-mess">unfair</a> to compare <strong>Ralph Northam</strong> and <strong>Justin Fairfax.</strong> What&#x2019;s lost in it all, however, is that in our fast-twitch world we can no longer judge these instances are their own. Instead, they are considered as misdeeds along a sliding scale or spectrum, with varying political consequences.</p><p data-reactid="240">Omar, for one, says she wants to do better. Can Republicans take her at her word?</p><p data-reactid="241">&#x201C;No one is perfect, but what we&#x2019;ve seen is that many in the right wing have zeroed in on Reps. Omar and Tlaib, as they&#x2019;ve done women of color across the board, in an attempt to silence them and delegitimize their thoughts and stances,&#x201D; <strong>Denzel McCampbell,</strong> Tlaib&#x2019;s communications director, told me. &#x201C;Both Reps. Omar and Tlaib have shown a great willingness to listen to their critics and grow from these experiences, because they are genuinely committed to mutual respect and understanding, something that other members must be willing to do as well&#x2014;and something we have yet to see from many.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="242">Even so, Omar is on thin ice with her colleagues. &#x201C;We hope that Representative Omar will learn from this moment,&#x201D; the senior staffer told me. &#x201C;Her position is not consistent with the rest of the Democrats on the committee.&#x201D;</p><div

hijacked by the staggering chutzpah of <strong><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/people/donald-trump#intcid=dt-hot-link\">Donald Trump</a>.</strong> &#x201C;Trump calling on a member to resign for having said offensive things&#x2014;that is beyond parody,&#x201D; a Democratic House aide told me Tuesday, shortly after the president said Omar should call it quits over a series of controversial social-media posts that were widely criticized as anti-Semitic. &#x201C;This is a president who said neo-Nazis were &#x2018;very fine people&#x2019; and stood by <strong>Steve King&#x2019;s</strong> bigotry,&#x201D; said a senior staffer to a Democrat on the committee. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s no reason anyone should take him seriously when it comes to denouncing

href=\"https://twitter.com/ilhanmn/status/269488770066313216\">2012 tweet</a> surfaced, in which Omar said, &#x201C;Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.&#x201D; The Minnesota congresswoman apologized last month, but set off the anti-Semitism tripwire again on Sunday when she invoked the late-90s hip-hop anthem &#x201C;It&#x2019;s All About the Benjamins&#x201D; to imply that pro-Israel members of Congress are beholden to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the powerful pro-Israel lobbying group. This time, the outcry wasn&#x2019;t just from the right: Democratic leadership issued a swift and stinging rebuke, condemning Omar&#x2019;s use of &#x201C;anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel&#x2019;s supporters&#x201D; as &#x201C;deeply offensive.&#x201D; On Monday afternoon, Omar issued a statement in which she &#x201C;unequivocally&#x201D; apologized, even as she reaffirmed the &#x201C;problematic role of lobbyists in our politics.&#x201D;</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>Largely satisfied with Omar&#x2019;s mea culpa, Democrats want to forgive and forget. &#x201C;It was a mistake.

But we can&#x2019;t waste days and weeks on this, because this is totally going to distract us from our agenda if we get hung up on this infighting.&#x201D; The tweet about AIPAC, this person said, was &#x201C;obviously a big self-inflicted wound, but we are not going to now look at the Republicans moving the goalposts and be responsive to them.&#x201D;</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>Republicans, however, aren&#x2019;t ready to move on.

On Wednesday, Vice President <strong>Mike Pence</strong> followed his boss&#x2019;s lead and called on Omar to resign. &#x201C;At minimum,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;Democratic leaders should remove her from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.&#x201D;</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>House Democratic leaders are not entertaining either idea. &#x201C;Ridiculous,&#x201D; a spokesperson for <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> told me Tuesday night.

impossible to know where to begin with the Donald, and you could write <em>War and Peace</em> and still not get close to describing the last six months of his 2016 presidential campaign&#8212;as if there’s a word that could possibly describe it. So let’s just zero in on the money.\n<p>“I’m <em>really</em> rich,” Trump declared while announcing his candidacy in June 2015. To prove it, he released a “Summary of Net Worth” balance sheet, indicating a net worth of $8,737,540,000. A month later he upwardly revised that figure to “in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS.” (The caps are his.)</p>\n<p>Since then, a cottage industry of spreadsheet-diving journalists has worked itself into a lather trying to peg his real net worth. But without tax returns to go on, it’s really anybody’s guess. Despite the all-caps figures Trump has dispensed, most estimates from the established financial-media outlets have been lower, FAR LOWER. <em>Forbes</em> put his net worth at $4.5 billion. <em>Fortune</em> postulated $3.7 billion, and later upped it to $3.9 billion. Bloomberg guessed it was “closer to $2.9 billion.”</p>\n<p>In response to these wanton guesstimates, Trump instinctually fired back at the guesstimators. “<em>Forbes</em> is a bankrupt magazine, doesn’t know what they’re talking about.” “<em>Fortune</em> has no idea what my assets are” and “has totally lost its way.” But the real sulfuric acid was reserved for the lowballers over at Bloomberg. As usual, Trump made it personal, even suggesting his “friend,” the former New York City mayor, might be jealous. “Maybe Michael told them to do it,” Trump speculated in the <em>Daily Mail,</em> “because he always wanted to do what I’m doing.” Perhaps wisely, <em>The New Yorker</em>&#8212;even with its legendary phalanx of persnickety fact-checkers&#8212;wouldn’t venture any closer than “just a back-of-the-envelope calculation” of $2.56 billion, “which shouldn’t be taken too seriously.”</p>\n<p>In November, Trump was elected president of the United States in a shocking turn of events.

government will not shut down again on Friday, and has agreed to back pay some 800,000 federal workers the salaries they missed during the previous 35-day shutdown. But when it comes to the federal contractors who also went unpaid during that period&#8212;up to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/13/18223471/back-pay-federal-contractors-shutdown\">580,000 people</a>, according to one estimate&#8212;it gets trickier. “I’ve been told the president won’t sign” anything that guarantees them back pay, Senator <strong>Roy Blunt</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/trump-blocking-contractor-back-pay-gov-t-funding-deal-lawmaker-n971226\">told reporters</a> on Wednesday. “I guess federal contractors are different in his view than federal employees.”</p>\n<p>On the 2016 campaign trail, it was a well-known (but ultimately overlooked) fact that Trump <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-business-plan-left-a-trail-of-unpaid-bills-1465504454\">routinely refused to pay contractors</a> during his career as a businessman. But the idea of paying these contractors reportedly had bipartisan support, until <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> shot it down. A legislative source <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/finance/429827-push-to-include-contractor-back-pay-in-funding-deal-hits-gop-roadblock\">told</a> the Hill that the administrative cost alone to pay back the contractors would be as high as the back pay itself, and that previous shutdown negotiations did not include this provision. “That was not initially part of our deal,” Senator <strong>Richard Shelby</strong> explained. “I personally would rather keep it narrow in scope.”</p>\n<p>Other Republicans, such as <strong>John Cornyn,</strong> seemed to take joy in turning contractor pain to political gain. “<strong>[Nancy] Pelosi</strong> and <strong>[Chuck] Schumer</strong> should have thought about this and other collateral damage when they initially refused to negotiate on border security, something they are apparently now willing to do,” he told NBC News. “Thousands of federal contractors have not been reimbursed from the 35-day shutdown,” Schumer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1095770911196831744\">said</a> in response to these reports. “This issue is hanging in the balance. . . .

of Trump’s infamous hue?","body":"<p>Long before <strong>President Trump</strong> decried investigations of his office over Twitter, a gentler query dogged the celebrity businessman: how does he maintain his infamous orange hue, even while residing in wintry D.C.? It’s a question that persists into the third year of Trump’s tenure in the White House, and investigations of the matter have yielded surprising insight into the commander in chief’s styling habits.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/us/politics/trump-tan.html\">The New York Times</a></em> pursued the idea as a matter of Trump’s health, though a senior administration official only offered that Trump’s notable tan&#8212;in February, no less&#8212;is the result of “good genes.” Further investigation revealed that neither tanning beds nor spray-tan booths exist within the White House or Air Force One, at least according to senior officials. Former aide <strong>Omarosa Manigault Newman</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/death-spiral-why-omarosa-totally-triggered-trump\">wrote in a tell-all book</a> that Trump travels with a tanning bed, while lighter-hued circles around the president’s eyes have fueled speculation that he utilizes goggles to protect himself from ultraviolet rays.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, neither bronzer nor tanning cream has been observed among Trump’s bathroom grooming products, at least when the president has offered a tour of the facilities to supporters. Trump, who suffers from rosacea, is reported to apply his own translucent makeup powder before television appearances, and has even adjusted the lighting at White House events to avoid appearing too orange on-screen. When possible, he prefers the natural light of the White House Rose Garden.</p>\n<p>Trump’s orange hue has also proven a frequent source of media ridicule, even as <em>Saturday Night Live</em> star <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> has suggested makeup artists deliberately avoid exaggerating the shade&#8212;at <strong>Lorne Michaels’s</strong> behest&#8212;so as “not to over-orange anything out of malice.” Baldwin has otherwise described Trump’s look as somewhere between “Mark Rothko orange” and a “slightly paler Orange Crush.”</p>\n<p>The president is famously self-sufficient when it comes to appearance, even detailing the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/photos/2015/09/an-illustrated-history-of-donald-trumps-hair\">elaborate process</a> behind his signature swooping blond hair. And while an unnamed former campaign hand admitted Trump’s orange glow is “a captivating story,” they insisted Trump’s grooming habits are his own secret to keep.</p>","rubric":"45

Get you a large adult son who can do both, as they say.</p>\n<p>Trump Jr. attended Malaysian designer <strong>Zang Toi’s</strong> show at Spring Studios on Wednesday. His look for the night was salt-and-pepper beard. Against all known <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/science-explains-why-a-beard-makes-you-look-hotter_n_6618142\">beard science, which states men look better with beards</a>, his look is more of a bot that is getting better and better at this smiling thing every day. His family <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2018/11/26/lead-pamela-brown-dnt-trump-ignoring-everything-jake-tapper.cnn\">has not put much faith in science</a>, anyway.</p>\n<p>Junior’s ex-stepmother, <strong>Marla Maples,</strong> was there, too, sitting a cool three seats away from him&#8212;close enough to look like they’re a part of one big party, and far enough away that she could convincingly avoid eye contact. (In past years, <a href=\"https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/presidents-former-wife-a-regular-zang-toi-10987395/\">Toi has invited</a> Junior’s mom and the president’s first ex-wife, <strong>Ivana Trump.</strong>) Between the biggest Trump boy and Maples was Fox News’ <em>America’s Newsroom</em> host <strong>Bill Hemmer</strong> and Fox News personality-turned-Don Jr’s girlfriend <strong>Kimberly Guilfoyle.</strong></p>\n<p>There at the fashion show, Junior told the press that he’s dating a cool girl. She fishes and shoots guns, he said, but also wears makeup and the fashions. “[Guilfoyle has] even been out with me down to Texas with some of my buddies there. They all go, ‘Hey, it’s a guy camp. Are you sure she’s going to be O.K.?’ I’m like, ‘Don’t worry, boys. I’m making you sign a waiver. She’s going to destroy all of you,’” he <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2019/02/13/donald-trump-jr-and-kimberly-guilfoyle-to-keep-it-low-key-for-valentines-day/\">told</a> the <em>New York Post.</em></p>\n<p>Toi’s finale look was an American flag skirt that could very well come to a <strong>Joy Villa</strong> near you next fall. (Wow, can’t believe this guy is co-signing a person dragging the American flag on the floor like that. What a shame&#8212;it’s like he doesn’t even respect America anymore, etc.) The designer made a special stop at the end of the runway to kiss Guilfoyle and shake Don’s hand. Who knows what he’s thinking as he smiles down at the designer. My best guess? “She’s going to destroy all of you,” over and over again, forever.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The dirty truth about <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/the-dirty-secret-of-el-chapo-downfall?inline\">El Chapo’s downfall</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; That time <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/02/brian-rea-modern-love-death-wins-a-goldfish?inline\">death took a break</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The 25 <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/25-best-movie-scenes?inline\">most influential movie scenes</a> of the past 25 years</p>\n<p>&#8212; Acupuncture and hypno-birthing?

embroiled in legal and political challenges to his decision earlier this month to declare a national emergency at the southern border. Now, he’s facing a new wave of pushback&#8212;this time, from a bipartisan group of 58 former national-security officials, who on Monday are expected to release a declaration condemning the maneuver and backing lawsuits aimed at blocking the workaround. “Under no plausible assessment of the evidence is there a national emergency today that entitles the president to tap into funds appropriated for other purposes to build a wall at the southern border” the group wrote, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/former-senior-national-security-officials-to-issue-declaration-on-national-emergency/2019/02/24/3e4908c6-3859-11e9-a2cd-307b06d0257b_story.html\">according</a> to <em>The Washington Post,</em> adding elsewhere that there is “no factual basis” for the move.</p>\n<p>The joint statement was signed by former secretary of state <strong>Madeleine Albright</strong> and former defense secretary <strong>Chuck Hagel,</strong> who served in <strong>Bill Clinton’s</strong> and <strong>Barack Obama’s</strong> administrations, respectively, as well as an array of prominent figures who served under both Democratic and Republican presidents. It represents still more opposition to the president’s contentious move, and is particularly humiliating for the administration given the source.</p>\n<p>But having nearly 60 of the country’s most prominent national-security experts tear into Trump isn’t just an embarrassment for the White House; the declaration could also prove handy for those attempting to block the nuclear option. Several states have already <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/nancy-pelosi-reveals-her-plan-to-dismantle-trumps-national-emergency\">joined a lawsuit</a> filed by California against the administration. Democrats are planning their own lawsuit, and are expected to vote on a resolution by Rep. <strong>Joaquin Castro</strong> to “terminate this emergency declaration.” That resolution will almost certainly pass the Democratically controlled House, and possibly even the Senate, where Republican <strong>Susan Collins</strong> has already announced her support.</p>\n<p>The measure is likely to die with Trump’s veto, but its defeat would represent a temporary victory. As even he predicted in a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/donald-trump-national-emergency-declaration-wall\">rambling Rose Garden address</a>, the legal path forward for the president’s emergency declaration is a difficult one. “We will have a national emergency, and then we will be sued,” Trump said February 15. “And we will possibly get a bad ruling, and then we’ll get another bad ruling. And then we’ll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully we’ll get a fair shake.” It remains to be seen how the national emergency will hold up in court, but Trump has already presumably hurt his own case by saying he “didn’t need to do this,” and that he “could do the wall over a longer period of time,” but wanted it built “much faster.” That the move is being condemned by the most prominent national-security officials in the country likely won’t do him any favors, either.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; A Republican <a

Last week, the Trump administration revealed plans to remove all American troops from Syria by the end of April&#8212;a position long championed by the president. The move rankled even some congressional allies like Senator <strong>Lindsey Graham,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/lindsey-graham-trump-syria-policy\">apparently</a> made his displeasure known to Acting Defense Secretary <strong>Patrick Shanahan</strong> over the weekend. Now, it’s clear lawmakers weren’t the only ones blindsided by the planned withdrawal&#8212;key United States allies appear to have been left out of the loop as well.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/allies-say-they-wont-remain-in-syria-after-us-troops-withdraw/2019/02/20/62e503b2-3532-11e9-a400-e481bf264fdc_story.html?utm_term=.9c6870c65501\">reported</a> that U.S. allies “unanimously” declined the Trump administration’s request to pick up the slack fighting ISIS in Syria if the U.S. removes its troops in the spring, as Trump has apparently directed Shanahan to do. A senior administration official told the <em>Post</em> that allies have made it clear they “won’t stay if you pull out.” Trump’s hasty move, then, could leave behind a powder keg. “It’s not safe to leave these enemies there, without any referee or mediating force,” said a U.S. official.</p>\n<p>His approach to Syria is the latest example of Trump’s seeming tendency to push policy without working out the details, which has frustrated even some of his closest allies. “That’s the dumbest fucking idea I’ve ever heard,” Graham evidently <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/lindsey-graham-trump-syria-policy\">told</a> Shanahan of Trump’s withdrawal plan in a meeting in Munich last Saturday. The South Carolina Republican, normally a staunch defender of the president, has been venting about the administration’s Syria policy since December, when Trump suddenly <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/donald-trump-syria-troops\">announced</a> it would be up to other nations to fight ISIS there&#8212;despite also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1075397797929775105\">claiming</a> that the terrorist organization had been “defeated.” Graham torched the policy, saying at the time that he would “hold the administration accountable for this decision,” and threatened hearings over the planned move.</p>\n<p>“It’s hard to imagine that any president would wake up and make this kind of decision with this little communication,” Republican Senator <strong>Bob Corker</strong> said at the time.</p>\n<p>But it appears that’s precisely how Trump has approached one of the most complicated foreign-policy conundrums of his presidency. While the commander-in-chief seemingly continues to talk out of his ass&#8212;on Friday, he said he would announce the “eradication of the caliphate . . . over the next 24 hours,” but no such announcement has come&#8212;U.S. allies appear to be losing patience. Last week, French Foreign Minister <strong>Jean-Yves Le Drian</strong> <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/syria/u-s-pullout-from-syria-benefits-iran-says-french-fm-1.6938647\">called</a> Trump’s call for withdrawal a “mystery,” and British Foreign Secretary <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> has said that “there is no prospect of British forces replacing the Americans” in Syria. Their pushback has left Trump hanging. Whether it will be enough to force him to reconsider remains to be seen.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; A Republican <a

Now Democrats want to know if Matthew Whitaker committed some light perjury.","body":"<p>Over at <em>The New York Times</em> today, you will find <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/us/politics/trump-investigations.html\">a lengthy look</a> at the various tactics <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has employed over the last two years in his ongoing attempts to defang the many, many investigations into his conduct. Chief among them, of course, have been Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/19/us/politics/trump-attacks-obstruction-investigation.html\">1,200 or so</a> public attacks on individuals and groups connected to inquiries into potential collusion between his campaign and Russia. (Trump has called <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> investigation a “witch hunt” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?l=&amp;q=witch%20hunt%20from%3Arealdonaldtrump&amp;src=typd&amp;lang=en\">dozens of times on Twitter</a>; other times he just blurts “witch hunt!” without any context whatsoever.) There’s also the time he <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/donald-trump-fires-fbi-director-james-comey\">fired</a> the director of the F.B.I.; the private campaign to remove <strong>Jeff Sessions</strong> for failing to “protect him”; and the hiring of <strong>Rudy Giuliani,</strong> whose job has been to wage a public-relations war to “undermine the credibility of both Mr. Mueller and the Justice Department,” which has <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/rudy-giuliani-robert-mueller-collusion-russia\">not worked out so well</a>. More recently, the president apparently used some precious hours of “Executive Time” to try to install a friendly face atop the investigation into his hush-money payments during the election.</p>\n<p>Last year, according to the <em>Times,</em> Trump summoned his newly installed acting attorney general, <strong>Matthew Whitaker</strong>&#8212;the one he claimed to not know despite <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/11/trump-denies-knowing-whitaker-who-he-met-a-dozen-times.html\">meeting with him on at least 12 separate occasions</a>&#8212;to ask him a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1068442531887632384\">very legal and very cool</a> question. Could <strong>Geoffrey Berman,</strong> the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, take over the investigation into <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-played-central-role-in-hush-payoffs-to-stormy-daniels-and-karen-mcdougal-1541786601\">Trump’s role</a> in paying porn star <strong>Stormy Daniels</strong> and former <em>Playboy</em> model <strong>Karen McDougal</strong> to keep quiet about their alleged affairs? In Berman, Trump obviously saw the perfect guy for the job, given his background as the son of a real-estate developer; his time <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/04/10/top-ny-prosecutor-geoffrey-berman-trump-appointee-recused-michael-cohen-inquiry/502367002/\">as a principal at the law firm of Greenberg Traurig</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/rudy-giuliani-greenberg-traurig-resignation\">which previously employed Giuliani until the association likely became too mortifying to bear</a>; and his <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-thought-hed-picked-his-perfect-us-attorney-in-geoffrey-berman-he-was-very-wrong\">hefty donation to the Trump campaign in 2016</a>. In Whitaker, too, Trump presumably saw a guy with a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/matthew-whitaker-world-patent-marketing-scam\">somewhat elastic view of right and wrong</a>, who would be eager to do his bidding. But alas! It was not to be:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Whitaker, who had privately told associates that part of his role at the Justice Department was to “jump on a grenade” for the president, knew he could not put Mr. Berman in charge because Mr. Berman had already recused himself from the investigation. The president soon soured on Mr. Whitaker, as he often does with his aides, and complained about his inability to pull levers at the Justice Department that could make the president’s many legal problems go away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The revelation not only highlights Trump’s continued reliance on <em>Sopranos</em>-esque tactics while working in the White House, but also puts Whitaker in an awkward situation vis-à-vis potentially lying to Congress:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Whitaker, who this month told a congressional committee that Mr. Trump had never pressured him over the various investigations, is now under scrutiny by House Democrats for possible perjury.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A spokeswoman for the Justice Department told the <em>Times</em> that the White House never asked Whitaker to interfere in the hush-money investigation. “Under oath to the House Judiciary Committee, then-Acting Attorney General Whitaker stated that ‘at no time has the White House asked for nor have I provided any promises or commitments concerning the special counsel’s investigation or any other investigation,’” said <strong>Kerri Kupec.</strong> “Mr. Whitaker stands by his testimony.” Meanwhile, it will undoubtedly shock you to hear that Trump has dubbed the whole thing “fake news”:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1097948574061608962\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1097948574061608962\">https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1097948574061608962</a></p></blockquote></div><h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Storms’-a-brewin","socialTitle":"Report: Trump Tried to Muzzle Investigation into His Porno Payoffs","socialDescription":"The president thought he could install a friendly face atop the probe.

Mess","promoHed":"Trump’s “National Emergency” Speech Was a Rambling Mess","dek":"The president’s lawyers must be losing their minds.","promoDek":"The president’s lawyers must be losing their minds.","body":"<p>If there is a national emergency at the border, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> wasn’t in any rush to declare it. The president showed up about 40 minutes late to his planned speech Friday morning in the Rose Garden and immediately began rambling about trade negotiations with China. He proceeded to go on a long tangent about trade, Brexit, Syria, and his plans for a second summit with North Korea’s <strong>Kim Jong Un,</strong> all without the use of a teleprompter. Eventually he got to the point. “I’m going to be signing a national emergency,” Trump said. According to White House officials, the declaration will allow Trump to redirect $3.6 billion from the military, $2.5 billion from counter-narcotics programs, and $600 million from the Treasury to build a border wall that Congress refused to fund.</p>\n<p>Trump appeared resigned to being sued for what both Democrats and Republicans have denounced as an unconstitutional power grab. “We will have a national emergency, and we will then be <em>sued,</em>” he explained, breaking into a strange sing-song voice. “And they will sue us in the Ninth <em>Circuit,</em> even though it <em>shouldn’t</em> be there, and we will possibly get a bad <em>ruling,</em> and then we’ll get another bad <em>ruling,</em> and then we’ll end up in the Supreme <em>Court,</em> and hopefully we’ll get a fair <em>shake,</em> and we’ll win in the Supreme <em>Court</em> just like the <em>ban.</em>”</p>\n<p>The government lawyers who will inevitably have to argue that case were surely appalled by what came next. “We have so much money. But on the wall, they skimped,” he said, complaining that Congress had not given him the $5.7 billion in funding he wanted. “I didn’t need to do this,” he added, potentially undermining any legal justification for an emergency declaration. “But I’d rather do it much faster.”</p>\n<p>It is hard to capture in text the utter strangeness of the entire incoherent, self-defeating monologue. As always with Trump, the <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?457952-1/president-trump-sign-national-emergency-build-border-wall&amp;vod&amp;start=34\">full video</a> needs to be seen to be believed. But for those who can’t bring themselves to watch 50 minutes of the president praising himself and berating reporters, here are the most absurd highlights:</p>\n<p><strong>On other emergency declarations:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s been signed many times before. It’s been signed by other presidents. From 1977 or so, it gave the presidents the power. There’s rarely been a problem. They sign it; nobody cares. I guess they weren’t very exciting. But nobody cares. They sign it for far less important things in some cases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On executing drug dealers:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[In China] a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty. Our . . . drug dealer gets a thing called, “How about a fine?” . . .  So if we want to get smart, we can get smart. You can end the drug problem&#8212;can end it a lot faster than you think.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On Paul Ryan, who advised him against focusing on the wall:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I will tell you, I’m very disappointed at certain people&#8212;particularly one&#8212;for not having pushed this faster.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On his biggest conservative fans:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Look, <strong>Sean Hannity</strong> has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do. Not of me. If I change my views, he wouldn&#39;t be with me. <strong>Rush Limbaugh:</strong> I think he’s a great guy. Here’s a guy who could speak for three hours without a phone call. Try doing that sometime. For three hours, he speaks. He’s got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world. I mean, this guy is unbelievable. Try speaking for three hours without taking calls. Taking calls is easy. “O.K., I&#39;ll answer this one, that one.” He goes for three hours and he’s got an audience that’s fantastic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On his friendship with dictator Kim Jong Un:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was a very tough dialogue at the beginning. Fire and fury. Total annihilation. “My button is bigger than yours” and “my button works.” . . . [But] I like him a lot and he likes me a lot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On Ann Coulter, who has called his emergency declaration a scam:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ann Coulter,</strong> I don’t know her. I hardly know her. I haven’t spoken to her in way over a year. but the press loves saying “Ann Coulter.” Probably if I did speak to her, she’d be very nice. I just don’t have the time . . . I would speak to her, I have nothing against her. . . . But she&#39;s off the reservation. But anybody that knows her understands that. But I haven’t spoken to her. I don’t follow her. I don’t talk to her. But the press loves to bring up the name “Ann Coulter.” And you know what, I think she’s fine. . . . I just don’t speak to her.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On where he gets his (debunked) statistics on immigration:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I get my numbers from a lot of sources, like Homeland Security, primarily. And the numbers that I have from Homeland Security are a disaster. And you know what else is a disaster? The numbers that come out of Homeland Security, <strong>Kirstjen [Nielsen],</strong> for the cost that we spend and the money that we lose because of illegal immigration. Billions and billions of dollars a month. Billions and billions of dollars and it’s unnecessary. . . . I use many stats . . . you have stats far worse than the ones I use, but I use many stats. But I also use Homeland Security.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On why he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, Part I:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think the people understand what we do. . . . Prime Minister <strong>[Shinzō] Abe</strong> [gave me]&#8212;it’s the most beautiful five-page letter. Nobel Prize. He sent it to them. You know why? Because he had rocket ships and he had missiles flying over Japan. And they had alarms going off&#8212;you know that. Now, all of a sudden, they feel good. They feel safe. I did that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>On why he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, Part II:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you look at Idlib Province in Syria, I stopped the slaughter of perhaps three million people, nobody talk about that. . . . Russia and Iran and Syria were going to go in and perhaps destroy three million people in order to get 45,000 terrorists. And I heard about it from a woman who had her parents and her brother living there. And she said, “Please, please.” And I thought&#8212;I said, “No. It can’t happen. What are you talking about it?” “No, they’re going to. ” And I come home and I read a certain paper where the story was there, that they were actually forming to go into&#8212;to, really, to really do big destruction. And I put out a statement that, “You’d better not do it.” And in all fairness to Russia and Iran and Syria, they didn’t attack. Or they’re doing it surgically, at least. Saved a lot of people.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

a Democratic resolution to block <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> emergency declaration, bringing the president to the threshold of a humiliating defeat. In a <em>Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/02/25/i-support-trumps-vision-border-security-i-would-vote-against-emergency/?utm_term=.c59e9099e2c4\">op-ed</a>, Tillis said he supports Trump’s border-security agenda, but is concerned about the precedent such an end around would establish. “As a U.S. senator, I cannot justify providing the executive with more ways to bypass Congress,” Tillis wrote. “As a conservative, I cannot endorse a precedent that I know future left-wing presidents will exploit to advance radical policies that will erode economic and individual freedoms.”</p>\n<p>Trump cannot afford one more defection in the Senate, or he’ll be forced to issue his first veto. Republicans <strong>Susan Collins</strong> and <strong>Lisa Murkowski</strong> have already announced their support for the resolution, which will almost certainly pass the Democratically controlled House on Tuesday. The G.O.P. controls the Senate, but four Republicans voting with the Democrats would be enough to send <strong>Joaquin Castro’s</strong> resolution to the president’s desk&#8212;a rebuke that would prove embarrassing for Trump.</p>\n<p>Presumably eyeing the narrowing gap, the president has begun lobbying his party ahead of the vote, tweeting Monday that he “hope[s] our great Republican Senators don’t get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security.” “Be strong and smart,” Trump wrote. “Don’t fall into the Democrats ‘trap’ of Open Borders and Crime!” Democrats, too, have been working to drum up support behind the scenes, Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/25/trump-national-emergency-republicans-1185526\">reports</a>, noting that leaders have circulated a spreadsheet to Republicans outlining the various military projects the president could pull money from to fund his wall. That may be helping to goose Republicans’ concerns about Trump’s so-called “emergency,” but it’s not clear whether it will be enough to turn them against the president’s overreach.</p>\n<p>As Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/25/trump-national-emergency-congress-1185589\">noted</a> Monday night, even Republicans who have expressed opposition to Trump’s use of the nuclear option&#8212;<strong>John Cornyn</strong> and <strong>Chuck Grassley,</strong> for example&#8212;have signaled they’ll stand with the president. Other Republican critics of the move, like the wishy-washy <strong>Marco Rubio,</strong> claim not to have read the one-page resolution. Others told the outlet that they “despise” Trump’s unilateral move as much as Tillis does, but are wary of running afoul of the president. “I didn’t want it to come to this, because I think it’s probably going to get tied up in court. And I said it wasn’t a practical solution,” Cornyn said. “I’m probably going to come down on the side of voting against the resolution of disapproval.”</p>\n<p>That means the most viable path to blocking Trump’s emergency declaration is likely the courts, where several states have already filed a lawsuit against the administration. Still, a formal rebuke of the president by Congress would be a significant symbolic victory, and a further sign of <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/dozens-of-national-security-experts-call-bs-on-trumps-border-emergency\">bipartisan opposition</a> to what <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> has slammed as a “fake emergency.” “Every Member of Congress swears an oath to protect &amp; defend the Constitution,” Pelosi <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1100157795960262658\">tweeted</a> early Monday evening. “We must not abandon that responsibility now.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; A Republican <a

about to do a deep dive on all the money Trump owes Deutsche Bank.","body":"<p>For the first two years <strong>Donald Trump</strong> was in office, Democrats <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/donald-trump-detusche-bank-russia\">regularly</a> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/donald-trump-maxine-waters-deutsche-bank\">attempted</a> to get Deutsche Bank to turn over information on its financial ties to the president. Of particular interest to lawmakers was the question of why, at a time when other banks <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/business/dealbook/donald-trump-relationship-bankers.html\">wouldn’t touch him</a> with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/16/deutsche-bank-examined-trump-account-for-russia-links\">20,000 foot pole</a>, the German lender was willing to loan the perennial bankruptcy artist <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/business/big-german-bank-key-to-trumps-finances-faces-new-scrutiny.html\">billions of dollars</a> in loan commitments and potential bond offerings. In addition, Dems had queries about Deutsche’s <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/31/investing/deutsche-bank-us-fine-russia-money-laundering/index.html\">relationship with Russia</a>, and whether it overlapped at all with our new president. Unfortunately, those questions went unanswered because 1) the bank wasn’t talking, and 2) Republicans who’d pledged to lay down in traffic to protect Trump were controlling Congress, and refused to help their colleagues use subpoena power to get the information they were seeking. As of January, however, things have changed!</p>\n<p>After taking back the House&#8212;and relevant committees like Financial Services and Intelligence&#8212;Democrats are preparing to launch a major investigation into Deutsche Bank’s habit of loaning Trump massive sums of money and, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/25/trump-money-deutsche-bank-1204497\">per Politico</a>, “whether Russia was involved.” Among its hires, the House Financial Services Committee has reportedly recruited veteran investigator <strong>Bob Roach,</strong> who is said to be “remarkably familiar” with money-laundering matters. According to Politico, Democrats believe that <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> investigation has done little to explore the Deutsche Bank angle to Trump’s finances. “There’s a heightened need to look into anything that could compromise the president or the country, particularly if it’s not being investigated elsewhere,” said House Intelligence Committee Chairman <strong>Adam Schiff.</strong> “I don’t know that to be the case, but I just haven’t seen any external signs that that’s happening.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For Schiff, Deutsche Bank is a starting point as his committee investigates possible money laundering by the Trump Organization. [Financial Services Chairwoman] <strong>Maxine Waters,</strong> who has called for the president’s impeachment, has said her inquiry into the “Trump money trail” would also start with the bank.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Last year, House Intelligence Committee Democrats outlined concerns they had about Deutsche Bank in a status report on the panel’s Russia investigation, which at that time was being run by Republicans. Among their questions: Did Trump’s financial exposure via Deutsche Bank or other loans represent a point of leverage that Russia could exploit? Did the Russian government try to court Trump and launder money through the Trump Organization?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Last week, Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/deutsche-bank-donald-trump-potential-default\">reported</a> that, following the surprise results of the 2016 election, Deutsche Bank executives were “so concerned” the Trump Organization would default on its $340 million worth of loans while Trump was in office that they considered extending the repayment dates until 2025, after the end of a potential second term. This, they figured, would pre-empt the public-relations disaster of either 1) <em>not</em> collecting the money and being seen as in Trump’s pocket, or 2) risking retaliation by a vengeful president&#8212;a possibility an ex-Deutsche source <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/are-deutsche-bank-and-trump-playing-chicken-over-a-dollar340-million-loan\">told</a> my colleague <strong>William D. Cohan</strong> that the bank is “particularly afraid of at the moment, given how much regulatory hot water it has been in over the years for a variety of reasons.” In the end, the bank decided to do nothing and, per Bloomberg, chose instead to simply not do any new business with the Trump Organization during the duration of Trump’s presidency.</p>\n<p>But, of course, Democrats want to know about the period in which the bank was more than happy to do business with a guy famous for being bad at business. “All we know is that there was one period of Donald Trump’s before he became president where he was spending cash for his developments all around the world,“ Rep. <strong>Emanuel Cleaver,</strong> chairman of a subcommittee with jurisdiction over money-laundering issues, told Politico. “Very few people pay cash when they do a big development . . .

Let Koch’s expert on water and chemical regulations decide.","body":"<p>Of all the federal agencies that fall under <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> purview, none embodies the administration’s unofficial mandate to do the exact opposite of its stated mission quite like the Environmental Protection Agency. For the last two years, the E.P.A.&#8212;which, as a reminder, is supposed to be protecting human health and the environment&#8212;has done everything in its power to turn the planet into an ashtray and convince Americans that toxic chemicals are actually totally fine to drink, breathe, and otherwise ingest, all in an effort to help companies secreting those chemicals maximize their profits. Which is to say, we probably should have <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/04/former-koch-official-runs-epa-chemical-research-1136230\">seen this one coming</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Trump administration has placed a former Koch Industries official in charge of research that will shape how the government regulates a class of toxic chemicals contaminating millions of Americans’ drinking water&#8212;an issue that could have major financial repercussions for his former employer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>David Dunlap,</strong> a deputy in E.P.A.’s Office of Research and Development, is playing a key role as the agency decides how to protect people from the pollution left behind at hundreds of military bases and factories across the country. . .He spent the previous eight years as Koch Industries’ lead expert on water and chemical regulations, a position that typically includes helping companies to limit regulatory restrictions and liability for cleanups.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dunlap was hired in October, according to previously undisclosed documents. Since then, he has been extremely busy, having reportedly been involved in high-level meetings that preceded the agency’s decision <em>not</em> to set drinking water limits for chemicals known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which “have been linked with kidney and testicular cancer, as well as other ailments.” (In a statement, <strong>David Ross</strong>, EPA Assistant Administrator for the Office of Water, told the Hive: “Despite what is being reported, EPA has not finalized or publicly issued its PFAS management plan, and any information that speculates what is included in the plan is premature. The agency is committed to following the Safe Drinking Water Act process for evaluating new drinking water standards, which is just one of the many components of the draft plan that is currently undergoing interagency review.”) According to Politico, Dunlap has been able to avoid a Senate confirmation hearing in which his prior work experience might come up because Trump has not officially nominated anyone to run to office. (Dunlap’s <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/research/david-dunlap\">official bio</a> on the E.P.A. Web site declines to mention any of his employers during his “more than 30 years” working for “private industry, trade associations and as an environmental consultant.”) Currently, Koch subsidiary Georgia-Pacific, a paper and pulp conglomerate, is facing at least one class-action suit related to chemicals now under Dunlap’s purview.</p>\n<p>Koch’s various environmental crimes against humanity are laid out in several high-profile lawsuits over the past 20 years. According to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20111005022145/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-02/koch-brothers-flout-law-getting-richer-with-secret-iran-sales.html\">Bloomberg</a>, “Koch Industries was assessed more than $400 million in fines, penalties, and judgments” between 1999 and 2003, such as for dumping hundreds of thousands of gallons of aviation fuel into a Minnesota wetland. “You want an independent, hardheaded scientific review of these issues; you don’t want somebody who is already taking the industry party line,” <strong>Erik Olson,</strong> who heads up the Natural Resources Defense Council’s public health work, told Politico. “There’s a legitimate threat there and, from my perspective, the conflicts of interest that [Dunlap] has having worked as a regulatory compliance director at Georgia-Pacific raises questions about whether he can make those objective decisions or should be recused.”</p>\n<p>Dunlap, of course, is unlikely to be replaced by someone without a host of conflicts of interest given that the guy currently running the E.P.A., <strong>Andrew Wheeler,</strong> is a walking, talking conflict of interest, having <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/07/06/626525274/get-to-know-andrew-wheeler-ex-coal-lobbyist-with-inside-track-to-lead-epa\">served as a coal-lobbyist</a> prior to taking over the top job from departed Grift King <strong>Scott Pruitt.</strong> It is, in other words, par for the course.

They did the same thing with the African-American players who were kneeling, trying to make it into an anti-American thing, an anti-patriotic thing, and an anti-military thing. But no one’s going for that.”</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>On Sunday night, <strong>Spike Lee</strong> won <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/oscars-2019-spike-lee-acceptance-speech\">his first competitive Oscar</a>, picking up the best-adapted-screenplay award for <em>BlacKkKlansman.</em> At the end of his speech&#8212;which Lee dedicated in large part to his family, the slaves who built this country, and the indigenous people who have been killed in the name of American expansion&#8212;he urged viewers to get involved in the 2020 presidential election. “Let’s all be on the right side of history,” he said, reading his speech off a sheet of paper and adding a call for voters to “make the moral choice between love versus hate.”</p>\n<p>Among the things he did not explicitly mention? <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> who, for the last few years, has taken it upon himself to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/donald-trump-oscars-2017-comments\">hate-tweet the Academy Award ceremony</a>. On Monday, Trump continued his tradition, this time aiming his ire directly at Lee and contorting the director’s acceptance speech, calling it a “racist hit on your President.”</p>\n<p>“Be nice if Spike Lee could read his notes, or better yet not have to use notes at all, when doing his racist hit on your President, who has done more for African Americans (Criminal Justice Reform, Lowest Unemployment numbers in History, Tax Cuts,etc.) than almost any other Pres!” Trump tweeted.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1100000030319169537\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1100000030319169537\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1100000030319169537</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Where to begin here? With Trump’s unverified claims about his achievements for the black community? His odd hang-up on Lee reading from his notes, considering the president’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJhBwbwSRBM\">own documented struggle</a> with reading his own written statements? Or his decision to single out a prominent black filmmaker and make him the sole target of his Oscar ire?</p>\n<p>Trump&#8212;we’re just guessing here!&#8212;<em>probably</em> isn’t too fond of <em>BlacKkKlansman,</em> which explicitly references the president and ends with sobering footage from the deadly Charlottesville protest that led to Trump’s infamous declaration that there were very fine people <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/us/politics/trump-press-conference-charlottesville.html\">“on both sides”</a> in that conflict. Lee has often criticized Trump on the <em>BlacKkKlansman</em> press circuit, frequently referring to him as “Agent Orange.” “He’s a man of hate, violence, and can’t be trusted to make moral decisions. We can’t be silent anymore,” Lee <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/07/spike-lee-blackkklansman-donald-trump-premiere-john-david-washington\">told <em>Vanity Fair</em></a> last July.</p>\n<p>Regardless, it’s not surprising to see a post-Oscar tweet from the president, who has made no secret of his disdain for the prestigious awards ceremony&#8212;perhaps because it, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/11/donald-trump-nobel-peace-prize-emmy-the-apprentice\">like the Emmys</a>, has never seen fit to give him a statuette. “I don’t know how much longer I can take this bullshit - so terrible!” he tweeted in 2014. In 2015, he wrote: “Show is terrible, really BORING!” In 2017, shortly after his inauguration, Trump claimed he would likely not watch the awards show . . . but ended up watching it anyway, later saying in an interview that the <em>La La Land</em>-<em>Moonlight</em> mix-up was “a little sad.”</p>\n<h3>More Oscar Coverage from <em>Vanity Fair:</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Check here for our <a

roots of Paul Ryan’s conservatism run deep. He was only 16 years old when he found his father dead in his parents’ bedroom. “I concluded I’ve got to either sink or swim in life,” Ryan told <em>The New Yorker</em> in 2012, one week before he was named Mitt Romney’s pick for vice president. His political views began to coalesce around that time, his brother recalled, telling <em>The New York Times,</em> “Paul went to work at McDonald’s and began to pull his own weight, and becomes class president the same year.”\n<p>Twelve years later, at the age of 28, Ryan was elected to the House of Representatives from his home state of Wisconsin, making him the second-youngest member of Congress. Steeped in the philosophy of Ayn Rand and his Roman Catholic upbringing, Ryan has said he was “miserable” as a freshman lawmaker during the George W. Bush years, when his party was complicit in helping run up massive federal-budget deficits. But the financial crisis and the election of Barack Obama wiped the slate clean for Ryan, who seized the opportunity to re-introduce himself as a beacon of fiscal conservatism and an “ideological hero” to the growing Tea Party movement. In 2007, he became the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, where he built his reputation as a policy wonk, before becoming chairman four years later.</p>\n<p>Ryan’s political rise during the Obama era was swift. In 2011, he burst onto the national stage by delivering the rebuttal to President Obama’s State of the Union address, and in 2012 found himself on the Republican presidential ticket alongside Romney (following in the footsteps of his mentor Jack Kemp). While Romney lost the election, Ryan emerged not only unscathed but also empowered as the spiritual leader of a newly energized party. His austere <em>Path to Prosperity,</em> popularly known as the “Ryan budget,” became the guiding principle of the arch-conservative 113th Congress, calling to replace Medicare and Medicaid with voucher programs, slash federal earmarks to benefit programs, and reduce tax rates for those in the wealthiest brackets.</p>\n<p>When the long-beleaguered Representative John Boehner announced he would be resigning his position as Speaker of the House, vacating his leadership post atop a party that had become increasingly divided between its establishment and Tea Party factions, Washington insiders turned desperately to Ryan to fill the job. Despite repeatedly turning it down, he eventually relented, and in October 2015 was elected as the youngest Speaker since 1875. In the final months of the contentious 2016 Republican presidential primary, the G.O.P. establishment once again turned to Ryan for salvation, hoping to draft him into a convention fight with Donald Trump, the party’s divisive front-runner. “Everyone thinks he’s Republican Jesus,” one Senate staffer was heard joking, though ultimately Ryan was wiser than to sacrifice himself for a doomed mission to save the party. There’s always 2020.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":2000,"height":1000,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/23/574363b2614dc9a45cb0a75b_hive-contributor-profile-paul-ryan.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 23, 2016 4:11 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-paul-ryan.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-paul-ryan.jpg","credit":"By Samuel Corum/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"574363b2c1f81aa45c8117eb","createdAt":"May 23, 2016 4:10 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 23, 2016 4:11 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 530977976","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/paul-ryan","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":2000,"height":1000,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/23/574363b2614dc9a45cb0a75b_hive-contributor-profile-paul-ryan.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 23, 2016 4:11 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Alyssa Karas","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-paul-ryan.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-paul-ryan.jpg","credit":"By Samuel Corum/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"574363b2c1f81aa45c8117eb","createdAt":"May 23, 2016 4:10 pm","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"May 23, 2016 4:11 pm","description":"Getty not 250: 530977976","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"57436398b09823be03ef3d10","revision":3,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/paul-ryan"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"Rom-Com Queen Meg Ryan Is Writing a Swoon-Worthy New Movie","promoHed":"Rom-Com Queen Meg Ryan Is Writing a Swoon-Worthy New Movie","dek":"And she might direct it, too.","promoDek":"And she might direct it, too.","body":"<p>You can’t talk about American romantic comedies without talking about <strong>Meg Ryan.</strong> She is synonymous with the genre, having ascended to ultimate rom-com queen status in the 80s and 90s. Since then, there have been plenty of attempts to usurp her throne, but none&#8212;<em>none!</em>&#8212;have managed to overtake her title. Though Ryan has spent the last few years on an acting hiatus, she’s also felt that old familiar call&#8212;and, at long last, is answering it. In an interview with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/15/magazine/meg-ryan-romantic-comedy.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, Ryan revealed that she’s currently writing a new romantic comedy of her own, with plans to possibly direct it as well.</p>\n<p>“It’s at Working Title Films. I’ll just leave it at that,” she said. “Getting the green light, <strong>David [Marchese,</strong> the interviewer]. My God. You feel like you’re jinxing it if you’re talking about it. Hopefully it’s for me to direct.”</p>\n<p>It’s what we deserve! Ryan only recently got in the directing game, helming the feature <em>Ithaca</em> in 2015. The film, decidedly not a rom-com, is a World War II-era drama about a bike telegraph messenger, starring <strong>Alex Neustaedter</strong> as well as Ryan, her son <strong>Jack Quaid,</strong> <strong>Sam Shepard,</strong> and <strong>Tom Hanks</strong> (who flew <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/09/meg-ryan-ithaca-interview\">across the country</a> to drop into the film and reunite with his old rom-com scene partner).</p>\n<p>Frankly, now is a perfect time for Ryan to get back into the rom-com game. Netflix has been churning out lighthearted romances over the last year, reviving and refreshing the genre <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/set-it-up-zoey-deutch-glen-powell-kissing-booth-joey-king-jacob-elordi-netflix\">with films like</a> <em>Set It Up</em> and <em>To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before.</em> The streamer also recently announced plans for sequels to <em>To All the Boys</em> and <em>The Kissing Booth,</em> another rom-com hit.</p>\n<p>In the interview, Ryan said that working on a rom-com of her own has actually changed her view of the genre. “I’m aware now that romantic comedies are confections, but they have construction,” she said. “There’s architecture. It’s not something I was aware of back then.”</p>\n<p>She also got candid, once again, about her departure from acting, which was sparked by her ill-received turn in the 2003 film <em>In the Cut.</em> “I think the feeling with Hollywood was mutual,” she said. “I felt done when they felt done, probably.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The <a

That’s according to a federal judge, <strong>Amy Berman Jackson,</strong> who, on Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/13/politics/read-judge-rules-on-manafort-plea-deal/index.html\">found</a> that <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> former campaign chair had lied to the special counsel’s office on multiple occasions, including about a meeting with Russian operative <strong>Konstantin Kilimnik</strong> in 2016 that has seemingly become central to the Mueller investigation. “[Mueller] has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant intentionally made multiple false statements to the F.B.I., the O.S.C., and the grand jury concerning matters that were material to the investigation: his interactions and communications with Kilimnik,” the judge wrote.</p>\n<p>As a result, Mueller’s team is “no longer bound by its obligations” under the plea agreement it struck with Manafort last year. And Manafort, who is already serving his jail sentence, cannot change his guilty plea. Manafort’s only hope for leniency, then, lies in his former boss, who still wields pardon power.</p>\n<p>Manafort was among the first to be indicted in the Mueller investigation, and was convicted in August on eight counts primarily related to tax- and bank-fraud charges. He cut a cooperation agreement with the special counsel soon after to avoid a second trial, but has evidently violated its terms&#8212;most notably in his apparent efforts to mislead investigators about the nature of his relationship with Kilimnik, whose August 2016 meeting with Manafort has emerged as a key episode in the inquiry. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-manaforts-2016-meeting-with-a-russian-employee-at-new-york-cigar-club-goes-to-the-heart-of-muellers-probe/2019/02/12/655f84dc-2d67-11e9-8ad3-9a5b113ecd3c_story.html\">According</a> to <em>The Washington Post,</em> prosecutors believe that Manafort&#8212;along with his deputy, <strong>Rick Gates</strong>&#8212;may have exchanged information with Kilimnik at the meeting related to Russia and the Trump campaign. Investigators believe the men may have discussed polling data at the shady rendezvous, as well as Ukraine, a key Russian interest and where Manafort had worked for years, the <em>Post</em> reported on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>It’s not clear why Manafort would lie about the interaction and other matters after entering his guilty plea with Mueller, but it almost certainly means he’ll face an even stiffer prison sentence&#8212;unless, of course, his reticence is rewarded with a pardon. Trump, whose cries of “witch hunt” have devolved to background noise, had previously expressed sympathy for his former campaign chairman, and praised him for refusing to “break” à la <strong>Michael Cohen.</strong> “Such respect for a brave man!” Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1032256443985084417\">tweeted</a> after Manafort’s conviction in August.</p>\n<p>The president has continued to hint at a potential pardon, including in November, when he <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/11/28/trump-says-pardon-for-paul-manafort-still-a-possibility/\">told</a> the <em>New York Post</em> that he “wouldn’t take it off the table” after prosecutors first accused Manafort of breaking his plea agreement. Perhaps this was Manafort’s play all along, or perhaps it’s a happy side effect. Either way, after Jackson’s ruling Wednesday, it’s likely his last, best hope.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

The <em>Times</em> spoke with seven women, including one who alleges that Adams exposed himself to her when she was a teen, and his ex-wife, singer and <em>This Is Us</em> star <strong>Mandy Moore.</strong> Adams, who has won seven Grammys, is best known for his career as a country-rock solo artist, though a cover album of Taylor Swift’s <em>1989</em> brought him increased name recognition in 2015.</p>\n<p>The <em>Times</em> based its report in part on thousands of text messages that Adams allegedly sent to a woman, whom the <em>Times</em> identified as “Ava,” when she was 15 and 16. The now 20-year-old said that Adams was corresponding online with her about her burgeoning music career when their conversation turned to graphic text messages and eventually sexually explicit video calls. The two never met in person, the report said. Through his lawyer, <strong>Andrew Brettler,</strong> Adams disputed the event to the <em>Times.</em> “Mr. Adams unequivocally denies that he ever engaged in inappropriate online sexual communications with someone he knew was underage,” he said.</p>\n<p>Adams was married to Moore from 2009 to 2016, though the two separated in early 2015. She spoke with reporters <strong>Joe Coscarelli</strong> and <strong>Melena Ryzik</strong> about her experiences with Adams, including what she called controlling behavior, for the <em>Times</em>’s story. “He would always tell me, ‘You’re not a real musician, because you don’t play an instrument,’” she said. In October, after Adams tweeted that he was too high on painkillers to remember their wedding, <a href=\"https://people.com/tv/ryan-adams-high-on-painkillers-doesnt-remember-marrying-mandy-moore/\"><em>People</em> reported</a> that friends of Moore <a href=\"https://people.com/tv/ryan-adams-constantly-belittled-mandy-moore-during-marriage/\">said</a> that he “constantly belittled” her during their marriage. Through his lawyer, Adams told the <em>Times</em> that Moore’s depiction of the marriage was “completely inconsistent with his view of the relationship.”</p>\n<p>Other former partners and acquaintances provided similar accounts of working with Adams. The women, including singer <strong>Phoebe Bridgers,</strong> said that he initially approached them with interest in helping their careers, before pursuing romantic relationships. Some said Adams attempted to hurt their careers after they refused his advances or ended their relationships. (Adams’s lawyer disputed the events in question, and suggested that some of the women have ulterior motives for coming forward.) One woman, <strong>Courtney Jaye,</strong> said that her experience with Adams made her want to leave music altogether.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The dirty truth about <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/the-dirty-secret-of-el-chapo-downfall?inline\">El Chapo’s downfall</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; That time <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/02/brian-rea-modern-love-death-wins-a-goldfish?inline\">death took a break</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The 25 <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/25-best-movie-scenes?inline\">most influential movie scenes</a> of the past 25 years</p>\n<p>&#8212; Acupuncture and hypno-birthing?

And people in communities like the ones I represent are suffering because of this division.”</p>\n<p>While Ryan stressed that he doesn’t feel “any pressure” to make his announcement soon, he’s sure acting like a candidate. The 45-year-old representative, whose district includes Youngstown and areas near Akron in northeastern Ohio, has already <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/429978-tim-ryan-seriously-considering-2020-bid\">turned up</a> in the early-primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, and has <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/henrygomez/rep-tim-ryan-is-heading-to-iowa-and-new-hampshire-as-he\">confirmed</a> he’ll be taking additional trips out there in the coming weeks. In his interview with Burnett Wednesday, the moderate Democrat struck a call for unity that sounded a lot like a campaign theme: “You can’t win the future divided,” he said.</p>\n<p>Ryan, who has served in the House since 2003, drew significant national attention in 2016 when he mounted an unsuccessful bid to unseat <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> and lead Democrats in Congress. At the time, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> had just won Ryan’s home county in Ohio by 7 points&#8212;a 30-point swing from the previous election, when <strong>Barack Obama</strong> won by 23&#8212;the first Republican to do so in more than four decades. Ryan had positioned himself as someone who could stop the Democrats’ bleeding in previously blue areas that had gone to Trump in 2016. “As I saw the blue firewall collapse, I was like: I need to step up,” he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/11/29/meet-tim-ryan-the-ohio-democrat-challenging-nancy-pelosi-for-control-of-house-democrats/\">told</a> <em>The Washington Post</em> at the time. “I need to be a bigger voice in the party.”</p>\n<p>He will likely take a similar position if he joins the race, tacking closer to the center than other 2020 challengers. That could give him some appeal among moderates, but it’s unclear how he’d be received by the party’s insurgent progressive sect. Ryan could also be overshadowed by more prominent Midwestern challengers like <strong>Amy Klobuchar,</strong> the Minnesota senator who <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/amy-klobuchar-you-bet-your-ass-im-a-tough-boss\">announced her bid</a> last week, and <strong>Sherrod Brown,</strong> the Ohio senator who has also been <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/sherrod-brown-2020-race-chances\">publicly flirting</a> with a run. Like Ryan, Brown is short on name recognition, but his appeal among both centrists and progressives could elevate his national profile. It’s not yet clear whether Ryan would be able to do the same.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

Prosecutors on Friday asked a federal judge to sentence former Trump campaign chairman <strong>Paul Manafort</strong> to a prison term between 20 and 24 years&#8212;plausibly a life sentence for the 69-year-old lobbyist.</p>\n<p>“Manafort acted for more than a decade as if he were above the law, and deprived the federal government and various financial institutions of millions of dollars,” prosecutors wrote in a court filing of Manafort’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/paul-manafort-could-really-use-that-pardon-right-about-now\">eight convictions on counts of financial fraud</a>. “The sentence here should reflect the seriousness of these crimes, and serve to both deter Manafort and others from engaging in such conduct . . . Manafort chose to do this for no other reason than greed, evidencing his belief that the law does not apply to him.”</p>\n<p>Manafort also pleaded guilty to two felony conspiracy charges as part of a cooperation agreement in September, but Mueller argued that plea deal was voided when Manafort allegedly misled prosecutors about his interactions with Russian business associate <strong>Konstantin Kilimnik,</strong> a former intelligence agent, as well as his contact with the Trump administration. Attorneys for Manafort argued at the time that their client’s mis-statements were unintentional, an assessment with which U.S. District Judge <strong>Amy Berman Jackson</strong> did not agree. Jackson concluded this past week that Manafort repeatedly lied during his plea agreement to assist investigators documenting Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>According to <em><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/15/paul-manafort-deserves-prison-sentence-20-years-mueller-says/2881393002/\">USA Today</a>,</em> prosecutors are also seeking that Manafort “be held liable for restitution and forfeited properties totaling up to nearly $30 million.” As to the punishment’s severity, prosecutors wrote, “Manafort’s age does not eliminate the risk of recidivism he poses&#8212;particularly given that his pattern of criminal activity has occurred over more than a decade. Manafort’s misconduct continued as recently as October 2018 when he repeatedly and intentionally lied to the government during proffer sessions and the grand jury.”</p>\n<p>President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has not responded to news of the prosecution’s recommendation. He has previously floated the possibility of pardoning his former campaign chair, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1032256443985084417\">claimed in an August tweet</a> that he felt “very badly” for Manafort and his family. “‘Justice’ took a 12 year old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him and, unlike <strong>Michael Cohen,</strong> he refused to ‘break’ - make up stories in order to get a ‘deal.’ Such respect for a brave man!”</p>","rubric":"Locked Up","socialTitle":"Robert Mueller May Have Handed Paul Manafort a Life

the films of 1998, was a watershed one in several ways. It was the first to air on a Sunday night and the first to see the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/shakespeare-in-love-and-harvey-weinsteins-dark-oscar-victory\">dark juggernaut of a Miramax Oscar campaign</a> fell a formidable opponent. With the Oscars of the present day in a state of disarray, let’s take a nostalgic look back at the way things were. (As we did for <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/02/1994-oscars-recap\">1994</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/02/1995-oscars-recap\">1995</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/02/1996-oscars-recap\">1996</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/1997-oscars-recap\">1997</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/02/1998-oscars-recap\">1998</a>.)</em></p>\n<p>It’s Sunday at the Oscars! For the first time, actually. The show used to be on Mondays. In honor of that monumental shift, ABC aired a little pre-show special called <em>Sunday at the Oscars,</em> with your host, <strong>Geena Davis</strong>!</p>\n<p>Geena turns to the camera and says, “Oh, and there’s you, you nearly billion people, you.” A billion people!! Sigh, the old days. Geena asks those billion people,“How are you?” Then, “No, really. How are you?” Could audiences talk back to the TV and actually be heard 20 years ago? How did we lose that technology?</p>\n<p>Geena then says that she forgot to introduce her escort, “the guy everyone wants to go home with this evening.” A kind of dorky looking guy walks out and Geena’s like, “Uh uh.” She’s talking about Oscar, not you, dork!</p>\n<p>Then Geena takes a little break and cuts to an interview with one of the evening’s big nominees, <strong>Gwyneth Paltrow.</strong> She says being at the Oscars is “deeply thrilling and validating.”</p>\n<p>Next up is the soon-to-be chair-walker himself, <em>Life Is Beautiful</em> director, writer, and star <strong>Roberto Benigni.</strong> “Hello, Jeem!” he says to <em>Sunday at the Oscars</em> co-host <strong>Jim Moret.</strong></p>\n<p>It’s funny that for a whole awards season, everyone had to deal with a crazy Italian jumping bean and his Holocaust comedy.</p>\n<p>For some reason, while Benigni is talking, the camera cuts randomly to <strong>Goldie Hawn.</strong></p>\n<p>Then the poor presenter tries to segue to a new segment, but Benigni is having none of it. Poor Jeem has to stand there and give an “It’s a living” grimace.</p>\n<p>Finally Jeem gets to the next bit, which is a little thing about how the Oscar statuettes were made in Chicago and then taken on a multi-city whistle-stop tour on their way to Hollywood. There was a sheriff-type guy guarding them the whole time.</p>\n<p>Then it’s back where we belong, with Goldie Hawn. (And <strong>Steve Martin</strong> and <strong>Kurt Russell.</strong>) Goldie seems happy, like she has a little secret.</p>\n<p>We get a glimpse of some of the stars on the red carpet, including <strong>Drew Barrymore,</strong> fresh off of <em>The Wedding Singer</em> and <em>Ever After.</em></p>\n<p>Now it’s back to Geena, who has relocated to the “Countdown Center.”</p>\n<p>The Countdown Center seems like a pretty unremarkable room, until it’s revealed to contain . . . <strong>Helen Hunt</strong>!</p>\n<p>Helen’s looking great.</p>\n<p>Geena plays a clip of Helen winning best actress the previous year. Present-day Helen looks on with wonder.</p>\n<p>Helen talks to Geena about directing the series finale of <em>Mad About You,</em> as all acting-Oscar winners from 1992&#8211;1999 were required to direct an episode of that show. “It’s unlike anything anybody’s ever seen. We made a little movie,” Helen says of the episode. Is that accurate?</p>\n<p>Geena then has to go to the next segment, and Helen isn’t really sure what to do during the transition.</p>\n<p>It’s time for a little clip feature, voiced by Geena, about the history of Oscars fashion. The reel features <strong>Barbra Streisand</strong> in a famous wacky number.</p>\n<p>There’s <strong>Jada Pinkett Smith,</strong> doing an alluring red carpet dance.</p>\n<p>And then! Our first (and sadly last) glimpse of Oscars Kween <strong>Sharon Stone</strong>!!!</p>\n<p>Watching this pre-show, I got very confused about why Geena Davis was doing it. Was it all just to promote the upcoming <em>Stuart Little</em>? Did she see <em>The Geena Davis Show</em> glimmering on the horizon? Was this part of some <em>Cutthroat Island</em>-related community-service sentence? We may never know.</p>\n<p>Doing these “Oscars 20 years” recaps is fun, but it’s also a little melancholy, looking back at a not-so-distant past and realizing how many things occurred that would never again. I don’t even recognize some of the names and faces! Like, who is this person who was apparently nominated for an Oscar that year??</p>\n<p>But seriously, remember when we were nominating <strong>Emily Watson</strong> for Oscars? We should start doing that again.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere on the carpet, there’s <strong>Tom Hanks,</strong> sporting what I’m assuming is some stage of his <em>Cast Away</em> beard.</p>\n<p>Then it’s back to the Countdown Center, where Geena is talking to <em>Affliction</em> supporting-actor nominee James Coburn. It slowly becomes clear that Geena Davis has not seen <em>Affliction.</em></p>\n<p>Then there’s a somewhat extended sequence in which Geena turns her back to us and talks at a screen. It’s really dynamic television.</p>\n<p><strong>Liv Tyler,</strong> at perhaps the height of her fame, post-<em>Armageddon,</em> attended the Oscars for the first time.</p>\n<p>Now it’s time for a little recap of the nominations process and the nominees luncheon!</p>\n<p>Oh dear.</p>\n<p>Ohhhhhh dear.</p>\n<p>Well, at least <strong>Warren Beatty,</strong> nominated for his <em>Bulworth</em> screenplay, was having an unimpeachable good time.</p>\n<p>And look! It’s baby <strong>Cate Blanchett</strong>! (This was her first nomination, for playing Elizabeth in <em>Elizabeth.</em>)</p>\n<p>After a bit about the set and rehearsal process for the big show, Geena Davis is joined in her room of requirement by a fabulously chapeau’d <strong>Céline Dion.</strong></p>\n<p>Céline immediately starts laughing.</p>\n<p>Geena Davis asks Céline about her rumored retirement. Céline says, “I want to try to have a little baby.” Which, sadly, never came true. As we all know, Céline Dion’s baby was enormous.</p>\n<p>Time for more red carpet shots! There’s <strong>Liam Neeson</strong> giving us the thumbs-up.</p>\n<p>And his <em>Cold Pursuit</em> co-star, <strong>Laura Dern.</strong></p>\n<p>There are some ads on this recording of the show. Including . . . <strong>Melanie Griffith</strong>!</p>\n<p>Also, an ad for the pants of the day.</p>\n<p>Jeem takes us on a tour of the Governors Ball, which apparently was held on the leftover Poison Ivy sets from <em>Batman &amp; Robin.</em></p>\n<p>And that’s that for this curiously low-key pre-show. Geena grabs her Oscar and trudges out of the Countdown Center. Of course, we know that she never actually left that room&#8212;that she’s said to still roam it, counting down forever. But we didn’t know that then. Then, we were only excited, because the show was about to begin!</p>\n<p>Now, only 48 screenshots in, it’s time for the main event.</p>\n<p>Cate Blanchett is thrilled about that!</p>\n<p>Hey look! Helen Hunt made it out of the walls of the Countdown Center and would like to say hello.</p>\n<p>Now that we’re inside, it’s time for host <strong>Whoopi Goldberg</strong> to make her famous entrance, dressed as Queen Elizabeth and searing herself into the brains of children the world over. These three blonde women approve.</p>\n<p>Cate liked it, because of <em>Elizabeth.</em></p>\n<p>Gwyneth liked it, because of <em>Shakespeare in Love.</em></p>\n<p>And <strong>Uma Thurman</strong> liked it for some reason too?</p>\n<p><strong>Ed Harris</strong> seems a bit confused.</p>\n<p>Whoopi introduces herself as “the African queen,” which gets a hearty laugh. In character, she jokes about how many movies that year involved Queen Elizabeth&#8212;I believe it was two&#8212;and then cracks wise about the length of the Oscars broadcast. “This will be a long show, so we don’t want to read about how damn long it was. We know it’s long. Tough.” Ohh, those were the days, weren’t they? When the Academy wasn’t <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/can-the-2019-oscars-be-saved\">madly scrambling to trim the show everywhere it can</a>, instead just leaning into the luxurious length of a Sunday at the Oscars?</p>\n<p><strong>Renée Zellweger</strong> agrees.</p>\n<p>Whoopi continues on with the show-length bit <em>and</em> the queen bit by saying, “I think we’ve all had our hair done enough times to know that you cannot rush a queen.” Oh! It’s a gay joke!</p>\n<p>Goldie and Kurt are not sure how to react to that one.</p>\n<p>Then there’s a tired <strong>Elton John</strong> joke (this dress really belongs to him!) and then Whoopi has to leave to get out of that crazy costume. So, she gives the stage over to then-Academy president <strong>Robert Rehme,</strong> joking that he was the guy who put Ned Devine to sleep. (<em>Waking Ned Devine</em> was big that year.)</p>\n<p>Goldie liked that one!</p>\n<p>When Rehme takes the stage, he seems less than pleased with the joke.</p>\n<p>Whoopi wasn’t wrong, and Rehme is totally boring. He introduces the evening’s first montage, a salute to movie scenes that the Academy likes. That’s all! Nothing more specific than that. Then it’s time for the Whoopster to really do her thing, but first we get a full glimpse of the strange bat-wing set they designed for the show that year.</p>\n<p>“This is the biggest party in Hollywood,” Whoopi says of the Oscars. “Well, maybe second biggest if you count the Democrats.” Hollywood liberalism in action! “This is the last Oscars show before the millennium,” she continues. Which is weird to think about. Not that it was the last Oscars show before the millennium, but that we were all so obsessed with the new millennium back then. What a big deal it was! Now we’re 19 rotten years in, and what has this millennium got to show for itself? Not a whole heck of a lot.</p>\n<p>But anyway, Whoopi makes a funny joke calling herself “the last 20th-century fox.” Goldie’s into it!</p>\n<p>Whoopi then does a “We Didn’t Start the Fire”&#8211;esque spoken-word list of terms related to Lewinskygate. It’s pretty corny, as are the next few bits in Whoopi’s speech, including a “Much Nothing About a ’Do” joke connecting Shakespeare and <em>There’s Something About Mary.</em> Gwyneth tries to laugh sincerely, but Whoopi knows she’s failed.</p>\n<p>Then there’s a bit about how the Oscar campaigns were so out of hand that year, particularly between Miramax (which had <em>Shakespeare in Love</em>) and DreamWorks (which had <em>Saving Private Ryan</em>). Whoopi says, “Those boys fought World War III over World War II!” The DreamWorks wives try to play it cool.</p>\n<p>Then it’s time to get specific about the nominees. Gwyneth Paltrow’s role in <em>Shakespeare in Love,</em> a woman pretending to be a man so she can be in a play, marks “the only time in history that a woman had her breasts reduced to get a part.” Gwyneth is tickled.</p>\n<p>Whoopi makes another queen joke, saying that <strong>Judi Dench</strong> is bound to play every queen in England. “Next year, she’s doing Boy George!” Quite a gag.</p>\n<p>That’s pretty much it for the lackluster opening monologue. It’s time to hand out the first award! To introduce presenter <strong>Kim Basinger,</strong> Whoopi says, “Last year, she took home two of the best-looking men in Hollywood: Oscar and <strong>Alec Baldwin.</strong>” Only 20 years ago, people were making jokes about how hot Alec Baldwin was. Just 20 short years.</p>\n<p>James Coburn wins for <em>Affliction,</em> and the lady behind him is very excited.</p>\n<p>During a commercial break, we catch a glimpse of this girl. Remember her?? From the ads??</p>\n<p>Now it’s time for Gwyneth Paltrow to present best art direction. “She actually did Shakespeare,” Whoopi jokes. “Please welcome best-actress nominee and sweet kid, Gwyneth Paltrow.”</p>\n<p>It’s kind of crazy how much of a coronation this whole night was for Gwyneth Paltrow. Look at that walk! It’s like she’s about to marry a prince in a Christmas movie.</p>\n<p>What good fortune that her film, <em>Shakespeare in Love,</em> wins the category. It’s the film’s first victory over heavy favorite <em>Saving Private Ryan.</em> It will not be the last. After that, <strong>Patrick Stewart</strong> comes out to introduce the first two best-picture nominees, <em>Shakespeare in Love</em> and <em>Elizabeth.</em></p>\n<p>While introducing the next presenter, Whoopi jokes that she’s always entering from stage left because of a “vast right-wing conspiracy.” How many more Lewinsky jokes will there be tonight?</p>\n<p><strong>Mike Myers</strong> shows up to promote <em>The Spy Who Shagged Me</em> and present best makeup. He makes a Zsa Zsa Gabor/mascara joke that <strong>Meryl Streep</strong> (nominated for <em>One True Thing</em>) just adores!</p>\n<p><em>Elizabeth</em> wins the makeup prize, and Cate Blanchett is profusely thanked. She takes it all modestly.</p>\n<p>And she gives a heartfelt round of applause.</p>\n<p>At long last, something big is about to happen! <strong>Christina Ricci</strong> comes out to introduce the first best-song nominee, a real barn-burner&#8212;or, I mean, bush-burner&#8212;called “When You Believe,” from the underrated animated film <em>The Prince of Egypt.</em> Ricci’s dress strap keeps falling down, as was the style at the time.</p>\n<p>It’s a big, righteous number&#8212;how could it not be, with <strong>Mariah Carey</strong> and Whitney Houstondebbie duetting?</p>\n<p>I’m a little confused about this triangle of gospel singers, but I’ll take a surprise gospel-choir reveal in any form. I’m glad those haven’t gone out of fashion.</p>\n<p>Then Whoopi comes out in a <em>Pleasantville</em> get-up and makes a <strong>Marilyn Quayle</strong> joke.</p>\n<p>I got excited that this recording is evidently from Boston, meaning whoever recorded this thing I’m watching in 2019 was sitting somewhere in my general vicinity when we both watched the Oscars that night, 20 years ago. Man. Time! Time.</p>\n<p>Anyhoo, Whoopi makes a beaver joke&#8212;having vaguely to do with <em>Leave It to Beaver</em>&#8212;and she makes a wicked little stinker face.</p>\n<p><strong>Nick Nolte,</strong> a nominee that night, loved it!</p>\n<p>So did Warren Beatty.</p>\n<p>Then it’s time for <strong>Brendan Fraser.</strong> He’d have a big hit in a couple months with <em>The Mummy.</em> But for now, he’s focused on little things: the live-action shorts!</p>\n<p>First he does a PowerPoint presentation about culture.</p>\n<p><em>Valgaften</em> wins! I’ll never forget the excitement of <em>Valgaften</em> winning. One of the directors loves a shoulder pad.</p>\n<p>Then a random lady comes out holding an Oscar. But for whom?</p>\n<p>She places the Oscar on the floor.</p>\n<p>Then the microphone lowers and lowers and lowers . . .</p>\n<p>. . . and then it’s the bug from <em>A Bug’s Life</em>!</p>\n<p>The bug is there to present best animated short, naturally. The announcer notes that the winning director worked on <em>Joe’s Apartment.</em> Surely the only time <em>Joe’s Apartment</em> has ever been mentioned at the Oscars?</p>\n<p>Then it’s time for best supporting actress, meaning Robin Williams takes the stage. He does a bowing bit that Roberto Benigni just loves.</p>\n<p>Robin makes some Robin-y jokes, topical silly stuff that is greeted with warm laughter. When Robin reads out the nominees, Judi Dench looks almost annoyed to hear her name.</p>\n<p>Is it possible that <strong>Blake Lively</strong> is older than we think and was seated behind Lynn Redgrave at the 1999 Oscars ceremony?</p>\n<p>Judi Dench is so mad when she wins.</p>\n<p>She cheers up by the end, though!</p>\n<p>After a commercial break, Whoopi gazes at a particular point in the audience and smirks. “Look at Goldie Hawn walking around!” she says. Goldie and Kurt aren’t back in their seats, so, they get called out, <em>Blue Man Group</em>&#8211;style.</p>\n<p>Goldie is forced to scoot past seat-holders, whom Whoopi has shooed from their chairs. Calamity!</p>\n<p>After that whole mess is settled, Whoopi goes riffing for a bit, eventually asking Roberto Benigni if he understands any of her jokes. He absolutely does not!</p>\n<p><strong>Chris Rock</strong> comes out to present sound-effects editing. “Thank you, <strong>Oprah,</strong>” he says to Whoopi. “It’s like the million white man march here!” He also mentions the Kazan thing&#8212;director Elia Kazan was receiving an honorary Oscar that night, amid much controversy&#8212;and gets some boos from the audience. Anyway, <em>Saving Private Ryan</em> wins its first award of the evening, on its way to an inevitable best-picture win. Right??</p>\n<p>It’s then Liv Tyler’s turn to introduce her dad and the rest of Aerosmith singing “I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing” from <em>Armageddon</em>&#8212;written by the great <strong>Diane Warren.</strong></p>\n<p>They do their usual Aerosmith thing and then there’s an older-man salute at the end. An older man in the audience responds.</p>\n<p><strong>Anjelica Huston</strong> then takes the stage to present best sound. Which is different than sound effects. This is before they changed the categories to sound mixing and sound editing. I like the blunt simplicity of “best sound.”</p>\n<p><em>Saving Private Ryan</em> wins, duh. Then it’s time for that film’s star, Tom Hanks, to do his Hanksian duty by waxing mistily about something Good and American. This time it’s astronaut John Glenn, who was having a moment because he went back to space as an old guy.</p>\n<p>Sure, sure, John Glenn was interesting, but OMG look at teen <strong>Mamie Gummer</strong>! Also, what’s Streep thinkin’ about, I wonder?</p>\n<p>Then it’s time for the “In Memoriam” segment. Incredible how many big names we lost in 1998.</p>\n<p>I could have sworn that Kennedy died in the 60s. No, I’m just joshing. Those names were just part of some sort of salute to real people who’ve been played on-screen. Great men, and a few women, plus a genocidal maniac and a Nazi.</p>\n<p>Next, Whoopi comes out dressed like Oprah in <em>Beloved.</em> “I’m a slave to fashion,” she says, which doesn’t land all that well.</p>\n<p>After that, <strong>Sophia Loren</strong> takes the stage to introduce <em>Life Is Beautiful</em> as a best-picture nominee. Benigni is very excited to see his countrywoman there, and to be recognized by her.</p>\n<p>Then Loren gives out best foreign-language film to <em>Life Is Beautiful</em> and Benigni does his famous chair walk.</p>\n<p>He really milks this thing, taking a big bow on stage and giving Loren a long hug.</p>\n<p>Goldie loves it.</p>\n<p>Benigni declares his love for everyone, and everyone falls in love with him. (More, anyway.) He’ll be back on stage later in the evening, of course.</p>\n<p>Now it’s time for <strong>Andie MacDowell</strong> and <strong>Andy García</strong> to present best comedy score together, because it’s important to pair Andies when you can. This segment affords us the thrilling opportunity to hear Andie MacDowell say “Patch Adams.” What a treat. <em>Shakespeare in Love</em> wins, deservedly.</p>\n<p>Then Geena Davis reappears to present best dramatic score. Geena! Good to see you again!</p>\n<p>The really exciting thing about this is that there are <strong>Debbie Allen</strong>-choreographed dance numbers to accompany the nominees. It’s a whollllle thing.</p>\n<p>Like, really a whole thing.</p>\n<p><em>Life Is Beautiful</em> wins, because people really liked <em>Life Is Beautiful</em>!</p>\n<p>Then <strong>John Travolta</strong> comes out to introduce a tribute to Frank Sinatra, who died in May of 1998. Travolta doesn’t call him “Stank Elantra” or anything, so let’s just move on.</p>\n<p>Then, this.</p>\n<p>And then just the energy boost this show needs: It’s <strong>Anne Heche,</strong> here to tell us about her time at the technical awards, held earlier.</p>\n<p>Ironically, or maybe it’s a whole bit I’m just not getting, Heche has technical difficulties with her mic.</p>\n<p>But no worries. Heche is a pro, and sidles over to a podium with a working mic like she’s been possessed by awards queen Sharon Stone.</p>\n<p>After Anne leaves us, sadly, <strong>Jim Carrey</strong> walks on to present best editing. He makes a joke about how he wasn’t nominated for best actor for <em>The Truman Show,</em> which really was a snub.</p>\n<p>He pretends to cry and it’s pretty funny. <strong>Kate Capshaw</strong> is fuckin’ loving it.</p>\n<p>But, Carrey inevitably carries the bit on too long. He makes a Benigni joke that sounds just a <em>little</em> bitter, in a genuine sense. Oh well!</p>\n<p><em>Saving Private Ryan</em> wins, further indicating that the movie is going all the way. I think it will! What could possibly get in its way??</p>\n<p>Next up is Renée Zellweger introducing the nominated song from <em>The Horse Whisperer,</em> <strong>Robert Redford’s</strong> “Baby, You’re a Horse and I’m Gonna Whisper to Ya,” with backup vocals from a young <strong>Scarlett Johansson</strong> doing a <strong>Tom Waits</strong> impression. No! That’s a joke. The song is by <strong>Allison Moorer,</strong> and is the only nomination that underrated movie got. I know people say it’s a corny movie, but give it a watch. There’s a lot of beautiful stuff in there, not the least of which is <strong>Kristin Scott Thomas’s</strong> excellent performance as an <strong>Anna Wintour</strong> type going West.</p>\n<p>Anyway! After that nice little song is done, Whoopi comes out in a big feather dress and makes a joke about the movie <em>The Birds.</em> It’s a perfectly fine gag, but it’s crucially important in that it offers us a reaction shot of someone we haven’t seen yet tonight.</p>\n<p>Shot . . .</p>\n<p>Chaser!</p>\n<p>Jack! Of course he’s here to hand out best actress, but we hadn’t gotten any audience shots of him until now. Thanks, bird dress!</p>\n<p><strong>Nicolas Cage</strong> then takes the stage to introduce the Thalberg Award for his <em>Moonstruck</em> director, <strong>Norman Jewison.</strong></p>\n<p>We come back from commercial break and Whoopi calls Benigni “an insane Italian.” Whoopi then summons Liam Neeson to the stage, to present best visual effects. <em>Mighty Joe Young</em> was nominated! Remember <em>Mighty Joe Young</em>?</p>\n<p>The surprise here is that <em>What Dreams May Come</em> wins, beating out <em>Armageddon</em>’s riot of fire. So, <em>What Dreams May Come</em> officially has more Oscars than <strong>Annette Bening.</strong></p>\n<p>After that, well . . . I don’t know how else to say this, but <strong>Val Kilmer</strong> walks on stage wearing a cowboy hat and leading a horse. The horse is not very well-behaved.</p>\n<p>Kilmer and the horse are there to pay tribute to screen cowboys Roy Rogers and Gene Autry, who died the previous summer. The horse is still not having it.</p>\n<p>Next up is Helen Hunt to present best actor. She gesticulates very passionately, as if she knows who’s about to win.</p>\n<p>Benigni wins, of course, becoming the first performer to win a lead-acting Oscar for a foreign-language film since Sophia Loren. It’s funny that Helen Hunt and Roberto Benigni have kissed on the cheek.</p>\n<p>He charmingly jokes that he’s used up all his English. But he does manage to say, “My body is in toomoolt,” and that he wants to make love to everybody, like Jupiter. I kinda feel like Helen Hunt is considering it.</p>\n<p>After all that effusion, we take a commercial break. Upon return, it’s time for Whoopi to lip sync for her life. Or, at least, to show off one of the costumes from <em>Velvet Goldmine.</em></p>\n<p>People thought that <strong>Lisa Kudrow</strong> could maybe get a supporting-actress nomination for <em>The Opposite of Sex</em> in 1998. Instead, she got to present the <strong>Randy Newman</strong> song from <em>Babe: Pig in the City.</em></p>\n<p>It’s fun to think that Sophia Loren once sat and listened to a song from <em>Babe: Pig in the City.</em></p>\n<p>After that’s done, we hear, “Welcome last year’s versatile Academy Award winners <strong>Matt Damon</strong> and <strong>Ben Affleck.</strong>” Hm.</p>\n<p>They give out best documentary short subject, to a woman who used to be Miss Japan. Sadly, <strong>Keiko Ibi</strong> seems to have never made another movie? Sigh.</p>\n<p>Then it’s on to documentary feature, which goes to <em>The Last Days,</em> a Holocaust movie produced by <strong>Steven Spielberg.</strong></p>\n<p>Uh oh!!!! Now it’s time to give Elia Kazan his honorary Oscar. <strong>Martin Scorsese</strong> and <strong>Robert De Niro</strong> are on presenting duty. De Niro is hairstyled like a <em>Butt</em> magazine editorial intern because, I believe, he was filming <em>The Adventures of Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle</em> at the time. What a reason to look bizarre at the Oscars.</p>\n<p>There’s a whole stilted intro and then a clip reel and than Kazan comes out. If I remember anything from this Oscars it’s <strong>Ed Harris</strong> and <strong>Amy Madigan</strong> not only not standing, but not even clapping. They were some of the people upset that Kazan was winning the award despite the fact that he named names to Joe McCarthy during the whole H.U.A.C. thing.</p>\n<p>Nick Nolte got in on the action too.</p>\n<p>After that tense moment, Whoopi comes out in the last nominated costume. For <em>Shakespeare in Love</em>!</p>\n<p>Whoopi makes a joke about all her costume changes, saying she hasn’t had to take her dress off this many times since her first audition. “Steven, you remember . . .” she says to her <em>Color Purple</em> director Steven Spielberg.</p>\n<p><strong>Sandy Powell</strong> was nominated twice in 1998, for <em>Shakespeare in Love</em> and <em>Velvet Goldmine.</em> She wins for <em>Shakespeare.</em> This was her first win. She’s won two times since, for <em>The Aviator</em> and <em>The Young Victoria.</em> She’s up this year for both <em>Mary Poppins Returns</em> and <em>The Favourite.</em></p>\n<p>Then <strong>Catherine Zeta-Jones,</strong> hot off <em>The Mask of Zorro,</em> walks out to introduce the final nominated song.</p>\n<p>The song is “The Prayer,” from <em>Quest for Camelot,</em> a Warner Bros. attempt at a Disney-princess movie that was a total bomb. It got an Oscar nomination for its song, at least, here performed by Céline Dion and <strong>Andrea Bocelli.</strong> Predictably, they sing the hell out of it.</p>\n<p>Meryl Streep seems super into it.</p>\n<p>Then “an actress of depth and beauty,” <strong>Jennifer Lopez,</strong> presents the winner of best original song. Is she flirting with me?</p>\n<p>“When You Believe” wins. <strong>Stephen Schwartz</strong> is not there to accept the trophy because he’s in New York rehearsing a show. Whitney seems displeased.</p>\n<p>Then it’s time for the actual “In Memoriam” segment. Here are some of the notable names.</p>\n<p>Folks, we’re almost there, I promise. For some reason, <strong>Colin Powell</strong> is introduced by former M.P.A.A. head Jack Valenti. He’s there to talk about <em>Saving Private Ryan</em> and <em>The Thin Red Line,</em> two World War II movies nominated for best picture.</p>\n<p>Once that’s over, Whoopi acknowledges the death of someone who wasn’t included in the “In Memoriam” reel: critic Gene Siskel. She gives a thumbs up to the heavens.</p>\n<p>It’s Uma Thurman’s turn to present, for best cinematography. She’s doing a weird British-ish accent? I guess a lot of people were doing that in the late 90s.</p>\n<p>Of course, the great <strong>Janusz Kamiński</strong> wins for <em>Saving Private Ryan,</em> pretty fitting considering he effectively <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/25-best-movie-scenes?verso=true\">changed the look of war movies forever</a>. A good win!</p>\n<p>Now it’s Jack time, baby. He looks happy as ever to be there, to present best actress.</p>\n<p>“I’m saying nothing because you’ve all exhausted every expression you have” is a great way to begin an award presentation toward the end of a long show. Classic Jack.</p>\n<p>Naturally it’s Gwyneth Paltrow who wins, her first and last nomination. (To date!) The waterworks start right away.</p>\n<p>She gets hugs from Blythe and Bruce and then heads to the stage.</p>\n<p>Gwyneth says, “My friend Cate Blanchett,” which is interesting. She also thanks, “The greatest one there ever was, Meryl Streep. I don’t feel very deserving in your presence.” Meryl appreciates that.</p>\n<p>Paltrow really loses it while thanking her family. It’s all very sweet.</p>\n<p>Blythe is having trouble handling it.</p>\n<p>A memorably emotional speech. Come back to acting, Gwyneth!</p>\n<p>Ugh. There’s more?? Yes, there is more. Just a little bit more. Stanley Kubrick had just died two weeks before the ceremony, so Steven Spielberg comes out to talk about that. Then it’s time for the screenplay awards. Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn are presenting.</p>\n<p>Steve asks Goldie if winning an Oscar was one of the most exciting moments of her life. She says, “Actually having my children was more exciting.” He responds, “Oh please,” and Goldie laughs gaily.</p>\n<p><em>Shakespeare in Love</em> and <em>Gods and Monsters</em> win the screenplay trophies, because the Academy likes stuff about showbiz.</p>\n<p>We’ve arrived at best director, which <strong>Kevin Costner</strong>&#8212;a winner for <em>Dances with Wolves</em>&#8212;is presenting.</p>\n<p>Spielberg wins, and gives Tom Hanks a lil’ kiss on the head.</p>\n<p>Ahh!! It’s her again!! And she’s talking like a mobster!</p>\n<p><strong>Harrison Ford</strong> emerges to put us out of our misery.</p>\n<p>And then the unthinkable happens: <em>Shakespeare in Love</em> wins.</p>\n<p>Yikes.</p>\n<p>Me neither, girl.</p>\n<p>Look, <em>Shakespeare in Love</em> is a wonderful movie, but obviously it’s been tainted some by the big man who muscled its way to this Oscar win. Still, I suppose we can focus on the many positives of the movie and not its clear negatives.</p>\n<p>Anyway, let’s skip <strong>Harvey Weinstein’s</strong> acceptance speech and move on to the end. Because we’re there! We’ve finished!</p>\n<p>Whoopi comes out for one last blessing, thanking the audience watching at home and nicely calling back to Keiko Ibi as an inspiration to follow your dreams.</p>\n<p>And that’s it, folks. See you next year!</p>\n<p>Toodles!</p>","rubric":"Nostalgia","socialTitle":"Recapping the 1999 Oscars Ceremony, When Shakespeare Beat Spielberg","socialDescription":"It was Saving Private Ryan versus Shakespeare in Love at the dawn of the modern Oscar campaign.","seoTitle":"From 2019 to 1999: Recapping the Oscars 20 Years Ago","seoDescription":"It was Saving Private Ryan versus Shakespeare in Love at the dawn of the modern Oscar campaign.","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Award Season","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","interactiveOverride":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["movies"],"revisionAuthor":"Brad Beatson","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5c6b97de3fc1123162a5c983","revision":68,"createdAt":"February 19, 2019 12:45 am","modifiedAt":"February 19, 2019 4:56 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"February 19, 2019 4:56 pm","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Award Season","slug":"award-season","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120b4f5c10202b9717a","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"movies","slug":"movies","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7f012afc00c253e55d8","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"bio":"Richard Lawson is the chief critic for <em>Vanity Fair</em>, reviewing film, television, and theatre.

In <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/vince-gilligan-men-of-the-year-kingpin\">later interviews</a>, series creator <strong>Vince Gilligan</strong> would surmise that Pinkman probably got away for good, moving to Alaska and living a peaceful new life. However, he added that it’s also entirely possible that Pinkman got picked up by the feds&#8212;and landed in a heap of fresh hell, which might be more in keeping with the the show’s dark purview. Soon, fans will finally find out what happened to Pinkman for good: according to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/breaking-bad-movie-is-a-sequel-starring-aaron-paul-1159128\"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>, the upcoming <em>Breaking Bad</em> movie is happening, and is also a sequel that picks up where the series left off.</p>\n<p>Sources tell the outlet that Gilligan has written the script himself, and is set to direct and executive produce the film, which revolves around Pinkman (<strong>Aaron Paul</strong>) as he makes a bid for freedom. In addition, Netflix will have first-run rights of the film, which will then air on AMC, <em>Breaking Bad’s</em> former network.</p>\n<p>Reports about a <em>Breaking Bad</em> movie <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/breaking-bad-movie-creator-vince-gilligan-works-1158881\">first surfaced in November</a>, with series star <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/08/entertainment/bryan-cranston-breaking-bad-movie/index.html\"><strong>Bryan Cranston</strong> confirming</a> that the project was forthcoming. He quickly dampened hopes of a Walter White appearance, however, by adding that he has not read the script, and doesn’t think it’s likely that his character will have any sort of cameo. “I don’t know if there’s an appearance . . . flashbacks, flash-forwards . . . but I’m <em>excited</em> about it, because it’s <em>Breaking Bad,</em> and it was the greatest professional period of my life&#8212;and I can’t wait to see all those people again, even if I just come by to visit,” Cranston said in an interview on <em>The Dan Patrick Show.</em></p>\n<p>Gilligan himself kept mum on the details, as has Paul. Representatives for the show creator and the actor have not yet responded to <em>Vanity Fair</em>’s request for comment.

<strong>Dr. Ruth Westheimer,</strong> famed sex therapist, wants an Oscar nomination for the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/sundance-film-festival-features-documentaries-on-lorena-bobbit-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-and-michael-jackson\">documentary</a> about her life that is showing at the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/sundance-2019-preview-14-films-to-watch\">Sundance Film Festival</a>, and she’s not going to rest until she gets one. The 90-year-old has lived a multitude of lives, from German-Jewish World War II refugee and orphan, to radio sex therapist, to television talk show host. She toured through the snowy streets of the Sundance Film Festival this weekend to talk about <em>Ask Dr. Ruth,</em> the Hulu doc directed by <em>The Keepers</em> filmmaker <strong>Ryan White,</strong> and advocated all the while for the film’s place at the 2020 Academy Awards.</p>\n<p>“The film needs an Oscar nomination,” she said with her unmistakably giggly laugh. “Just the nomination. If something else comes along, too, like the prize, you can have it,” she said, motioning to White.</p>\n<p>It’s not a crazy proposition. The doc, which White shot over the better part of the last two years, tracks Westheimer’s traumatic childhood when, at age 10, she was sent to an orphanage in Switzerland as part of the <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/kindertransport-1938-40\">Kindertransport</a> at the beginning of WWII. (It was the last time she ever saw her parents.) From there, the film travels to Israel, where Westheimer lived on a kibbutz and had her sexual awakening, then to Paris with her first husband, where she began studying for a college degree (she eventually received a doctorate in education from Columbia University’s Teachers College). The film then tracks her arrival in New York, where, as a single mother who divorced her second husband, she found her calling with sex therapy, married her longtime partner, Fred Westheimer, and rose to fame as the woman who spoke the truth about sex and advocated for gay rights.</p>\n<p>Filmmakers have been trying to make a documentary about Westheimer’s life for decades. She says she’s received offers from all over the world. Now was the first time when she felt the need to tell her story.</p>\n<p>“There is an obligation by me to stand up and be counted for some of the things that are happening today,” she said. “Even though I don’t do politics, I’m very upset about what’s happening with <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/donald-trump-child-detention-crisis-is-getting-worse\">children being separated from their parents</a>, because that’s my story. But I also said yes because I need to combat the people that are deniers of the Holocaust, and who have fatigue [from hearing about the] Holocaust, to make sure something like this doesn’t happen again.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/5c4fbec8279551454b000012.js?muted=1\"></div></div><p>A very poignant moment in the film follows Westheimer to <a href=\"https://www.yadvashem.org/\">Yad Vashem</a>, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Jerusalem, where visitors can look up the names of the people who perished during Germany’s Nazi regime. Westheimer knew her parents had died at the hand of the Nazis prior to visiting the museum, but wanted others to know that the institution and its database exists.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to be able to teach young people that the older generation had horrible things happen to them, and that the Nazis kept track of each single person, with their birth date and their death date,” Westheimer said. “I knew already that next to my mother’s name it says the German word for ‘disappear.’ It makes me very sad. All I can think about is, disappear where? Where is her grave? One important part of what has happened here [with this documentary] is now, symbolically, I have a grave for my whole family.”</p>\n<p>It’s easy to fall in love with Westheimer. Her joyous spirit and easy laugh are contagious&#8212;and that’s before you ask her any sex questions. Being in her 90s has not curbed any of her enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>And she can’t stop raving about White’s work on the film&#8212;hence the quest for an Academy Award&#8212;from his ability to balance the light and the dark in her life, to the film’s animated segments, which beautifully illustrate her time in the orphanage, and initially concerned her. “I was worried,” Westheimer said. “I didn’t want it turned into a cartoon.”</p>\n<p>White was similarly concerned.</p>\n<p>“It was a huge boon that Dr. Ruth had kept all those letters from her parents&#8212;what amazing content for a documentary filmmaker, to be able to use her voice and her parents’ voices. But how do you illustrate it?” asked White. “I always wanted her childhood to be a big part of the film, but I didn’t want to use B-roll of train stations and footage from the Holocaust to tell these harrowing tales. I was obsessed with [her] eyes, and making sure the animated version of [her] eyes looked just like the real ones, since I wanted all the animation to be seen through [them].”</p>\n<p>Westheimer is specifically charged by the poignancy of the animated sequence inside a Frankfurt train station when she says goodbye to her mother and grandmother as she departs to Switzerland, waving to them from inside the train while the two women clutch each other on a platform.</p>\n<p>“That railroad station was filled with people, but for me, the only thing that counted were my mother and grandmother, standing there,” Westheimer said. “That station was filled with loneliness. It just cries out to you. I’ve never seen in my life the graphic version of loneliness. It’s brilliant. And it’s absolutely true.”</p>\n<p>It’s also something Westheimer wants to use in her family-and-media class at Teachers College. Yes, she still teaches. She’s also currently working on a new version of her 1995 best-selling book, <em>Sex For Dummies,</em> this time focused on millennials. She’s worried about what modern technology is doing to our culture, concerned specifically with issues of loneliness and how smartphones usurp our ability to communicate with each other.</p>\n<p>“If it’s two people going on a date, that phone is always on the table as if there is something happening in the world they have to know about right now,” Westheimer said. “People are going to lose the art of conversation. You see families at a restaurant and the kids are on the phone and the adults are on the phone. It’s just a catastrophe.”</p>\n<p>Westheimer’s life and outlook is reminder of the indelible human spirit. So what say you, Academy?

Film school with the likes of <strong>Debra Granik</strong> (<em>Winter’s Bone</em>), <strong>Joshua Marston</strong> (<em>Maria Full of Grace</em>), and documentarian <strong>Lucy Walker</strong> (<em>Devil’s Playground),</em> an amazing group of colleagues who went on to have glorious debuts at the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/sundance-2019-preview-14-films-to-watch\">Sundance Film Festival</a> followed by lucrative careers in Hollywood. Ganatra’s debut, <em>Chutney Popcorn,</em> launched at the Berlin Film Festival in 1999, won an audience award there, and became a cult hit among gay audiences (it centered on a young, gay Indian woman played by Ganatra). And then . . . crickets.</p>\n<p>There was no courtship by Hollywood, no lucrative deals, just meetings where people kept asking Ganatra what other gay Indian tales she wanted to tell.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward, and after two decades of hard work, including the indie film <em>Fast Food High,</em> a Hallmark movie (<em>Pete’s Christmas</em>), and some stellar episodes of TV (<em>Transparent,</em> <em>Mr. Robot,</em> <em>Better Things,</em> <em>Girls</em>), Ganatra is finally getting her Sundance moment. Her new film, <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/late-night-movie-review-emma-thompson-mindy-kaling\">Late Night</a>,</em> written by and starring <strong>Mindy Kaling,</strong> centers on <strong>Emma Thompson’s</strong> character, Katherine&#8212;a fading late-night talk-show host forced to hire a female writer (Kaling) to help diversify her all-white, all-male writers’ room. The film brought down the house at the cavernous Eccles Theater on both Friday night and Saturday morning, and just sold to Amazon Studios for $13 million, one of the biggest deals in the festival’s history.</p>\n<p>“Because the movie has two female leads&#8212;one is over the age of 50, and one is a woman of color&#8212;it was being framed as risky, and [people were asking], ‘Will it find an audience, will people like it?,’” said Ganatra. “The fact that it received a standing ovation and a record-breaking sale at Sundance is incredibly awesome and will help all the movies like it coming after. That’s the goal&#8212;to get more women in the door, more people of color in the door, and more of these stories on-screen so we can all have a more enriching entertainment experience. That’s pretty exciting.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/5c48d2452795511ceb00000b.js?autoplay=0\"></div></div><p>Kaling, who first met Ganatra when she directed an episode of <em>The Mindy Project</em> back in 2015, hired the 44-year-old director after she delivered her pitch like the “good Indian nerd” that she is: with a full laptop presentation that showed her inspiration and references for how she wanted <em>Late Night</em> to look. It turned out to be the same references Kaling had for the project: <em>Working Girl,</em> <em>Broadcast News,</em> <em>Tootsie,</em> and even <em>American President.</em></p>\n<p>“We went through all the films that inspired us. Films that make you feel uplifted, and made you think about something in a different way, but were never preachy,” said Ganatra during an interview in the middle of her Sundance whirlwind. “There are very few Indian-American women working in comedy right now, and I think it was really bold of [Kaling] to say, ‘O.K., direct this movie for me.’ It was risky and beautiful and I’m glad it paid off.” (<em>Late Night</em> was originally set up at 20th Century Fox with producer <strong>Scott Rudin</strong> and director <strong>Paul Feig,</strong> but Kaling extracted it from the studio after it was put into turnaround. Indie outfits 30West and Film Nation financed the movie.)</p>\n<p>Shot in 25 days, and written before the #MeToo movement took hold at the end of 2017, <em>Late Night</em> deals with many hot-button issues today&#8212;diversification, slut-shaming&#8212;but never in a way that feels overbearing. Rather, it’s a love letter to those single-minded strivers out there who will give up everything in their quest to reach their career goals. And it’s a brilliant showcase for Thompson, who fully breaks out of the period genre she’s become so well known for, and returns her to her comedic roots. There is even a snippet of a 1983 stand-up routine of Thompson’s featured in the movie. At 59, the British actress has never looked better, including in scenes where Ganatra says she didn’t wear make-up.</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/5c4e79ff40f94878f7000002.js?muted=1\"></div></div><p>“[Emma] said, ‘I just got ready for bed [in this scene], why would I have makeup on?,’” said Ganatra. “She’s so great about trying to break down that idiotic thing of trying to look like we’re not human.”</p>\n<p>Ganatra tells a story about how on some movie sets there are people whose job it is to make sure actresses don’t show their neck by turning their heads too far to one side. Actresses often will ask their director to move their eyeline so they don’t look too far to one side. Said Ganatra: “Emma stopped everything and said, ‘Are we living in a world where we are trying to pretend that women’s necks don’t wrinkle when they look over their shoulder, and what are we doing if we are?’ In such a simple, funny comment she took down the entire beauty industry.”</p>\n<p><em>Late Night</em> operates on many planes, both as a big, glossy movie that could easily have been made by a big studio, and also as a piece that analyzes our current culture. It’s exactly the kind of movie Ganatra dreamt of. “I’ve always wanted to make movies centered on women and their stories, but which also worked on two levels&#8212;they are entertaining and make you laugh, but they also have something to say. This movie fulfilled all of those dreams.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em>’s long and troubled <a

Hopefully within a few months, fans will at least have a theme to guess and theorize about&#8212;but for now, at least we know that Roberts will be back, probably to play another delightful brat.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/the-worst-kept-secret-of-trumps-presidency?inline\">worst-kept secret</a> of Trump’s presidency</p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Silicon Valley suffocating the media?

Landgraf, who gained a reputation as a television-industry sage after warning the industry about the coming glut of scripted content (a phenomenon also known as <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/08/netflix-john-landgraf-peak-tv-diversity\">“peak TV”</a>), immediately went on the offensive against Netflix in particular, accusing the streamer of playing an unfair game in which it self-reports ratings while refusing to play by the Nielsen metrics that other networks are bound to.</p>\n<p>Netflix recently proclaimed that <em>You,</em> a series that originally aired on Lifetime before moving to the streaming platform, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/netflix-you-bird-box-viewers-numbers\">was on track to be “watched by over 40 million member households”</a> in its first four weeks on its new platform&#8212;but Landgraf took issue with that number, saying that the streamer had counted households watching just part of an episode, rather than only considering total viewership per episode. If you applied standard metrics to their data, he claimed, it would look more like eight million viewers per episode&#8212;a respectable number, but not the enormous phenomenon Netflix has reported the show to be.</p>\n<p>“By reporting their singles as if they were home runs,” Landgraf said, the streamer has misrepresented both the number and the true scale of its hits&#8212;suggesting that it alone has figured out the secret to the TV universe.</p>\n<p>“The truth will ultimately come out, as it always does,” he quipped.</p>\n<p>In December, FX released a <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-peak-tv-fx-2018-report-20181213-story.html\">report</a> suggesting that for the first time, streamers are churning out more original content than broadcast and cable networks: 160 scripted original series ran on streaming services last year (not counting reality shows or kids programs), compared to 146 on broadcast networks and 144 on basic cable. During this panel, Landgraf also noted that FX is “laser-focused” on quality rather than quantity. He pointed out that FX (which expects to become part of Disney following Disney’s acquisition of major Fox assets) saw 13 of its 14 original scripted series appear on 2018 year-end best lists compiled by critics&#8212;a much higher batting average than competitors like HBO, which saw 20 out of its 70 series represented, or Netflix, which had 62 out of 530 originals on those lists, per FX.</p>\n<p>Landgraf proclaimed again that having a high-quality brand is the best way to cut through the noise of the peak-TV era, especially as streamers proliferate and churn out programming. He also noted, however, that “the enemy of excellence is time. . . . If you want to get things right, you have to stop sometimes. You have to slow down.” This focus on quality, according to Landgraf, is why FX’s highly anticipated adaptation of <em>Y</em>&#8212;which has finally been ordered to series, with <strong>Diane Lane</strong>  starring&#8212;took longer to come to fruition than some fans had hoped it would. “It’s not an easy adaptation; it’s taken a long time to get it right,” Landgraf said. And though Landgraf critiqued Netflix and the tech industry’s “winner-takes-all” attitude, he also noted that he was “really grateful” that FX will soon be part of a powerful streaming platform itself: once Disney acquires Twentieth Century Fox, Disney will hold a 60 percent stake in Hulu.</p>\n<p>This spring, the network will launch <em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/fosse-verdon-teaser-trailer-fx-sam-rockwell-michelle-williams\">Fosse/Verdon</a>,</em> a limited series about the creative collaboration and romantic relationship between legendary choreographer and director Bob Fosse (played by <strong>Sam Rockwell</strong>) and Broadway star Gwen Verdon (<strong>Michelle Williams</strong>). The series also boasts mega-talent behind the scenes, including executive producer <strong>Lin-Manuel Miranda,</strong> <em>Hamilton</em> director <strong>Thomas Kail,</strong> <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em> playwright <strong>Steven Levenson,</strong> and <em>The Americans</em> show-runner <strong>Joel Fields,</strong> an alum of one of FX’s greatest hits. The network is also premiering <em>What We Do in the Shadows,</em> a half-hour vampire comedy series based on the movie of the same name by co-creators <strong>Jemaine Clement</strong> and <strong>Taika Waititi.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ryan Murphy,</strong> a longtime FX creator who recently decamped to Netflix, may be <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/ryan-murphy-netflix-the-politician-jessica-lange\">luring</a> some of his old FX team over to his new shows&#8212;but Landgraf also promised that his network would host more seasons of both <em>American Horror Story</em> and <em>American Crime Story,</em> though he did admit that a planned season of the latter about Hurricane Katrina, which has had a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/annette-bening-american-crime-story-katrina\">long and torturous production process</a>, is now officially dead.</p>\n<p>Of <em>Crime Story,</em> Landgraf said, “We have three or four ideas in active development, with writers at work on them. I couldn’t tell you which one is likely to be ready first.” (We know, though, that another planned season about <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> and <strong>Monica Lewinsky</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/04/american-crime-story-lewinsky-ryan-murphy\">also been scuttled</a>. And although Murphy has not pitched any ideas for further seasons of <em>Feud</em>&#8212;at least, not since <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/08/fx-feud-prince-charles-princess-diana\">ditching his <strong>Prince Charles</strong> and Diana-themed season</a>&#8212;Landgraf said, “I wouldn’t be surprised if I get a call about another cycle.”</p>","rubric":"TCA","socialTitle":"FX C.E.O.

The reason for Ryan’s giddiness, of course, was that Congress had just <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/12/paul-ryan-can-barely-suppress-his-tax-reform-orgasm\">passed</a> a “middle-class” tax bill that would disproportionately benefit the rich, i.e., one of his lifelong dreams. And with the ink barely dry on that aspiration, Ryan turned to another long-sought goal: destroying the social safety net. Practically licking his lips at the idea of slashing Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security, Ryan <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/12/paul-ryan-lustfully-eyes-welfare-reform\">told</a> hosts at various news outlets that he could not imagine a better follow-up to a historic transfer of wealth thinly disguised as tax “reform” than putting the old, sick, and poor on notice. Unfortunately, Ryan‘s dream, and that of many people who simultaneously believe in corporate welfare and telling the homeless to “get a job,” did not come to pass before he announced his retirement in April, a regret that got a pointed shout-out in his goodbye speech today.</p>\n<p>“I acknowledge plainly that my ambitions for entitlement reform have outpaced the political reality, and I consider this our greatest unfinished business,” the Ayn Rand devotee <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/4777401/paul-ryan-farewell-speech-house-speaker/\">told</a> his colleagues on Wednesday, as though he was a dying man ruing the fact that he wouldn’t live to see the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, except he was talking about slapping the blood pressure medication out of grandma’s mouth. “Ultimately, solving this problem will require a greater degree of political will than exists today. I regret that.”</p>\n<p>Yes, leaving Congress without obliterating the social safety net will surely keep Ryan up at night for some time. Luckily, though, when things get really rough, and he wakes up in a cold sweat from a nightmare in which he almost‚ <em>almost</em> had the chance to kill off a busload of senior citizens but whiffed it at the last second, he’ll have something tangible to buoy him: a six-part docuseries released by his office this week detailing his 20-year quest to cut taxes on the rich, titled <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS9k2JdaexI0SXrt6DI9jGAD1m7nJQIrv\">Decades in the Making</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/SpeakerRyan/status/1074997907412135936\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpeakerRyan/status/1074997907412135936\">https://twitter.com/SpeakerRyan/status/1074997907412135936</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Positioning Ryan like an outsider struggling against The Man, the presumably taxpayer-funded hagiography includes interviews with former staffers, Ryan’s brother, and the congressman himself about what it was like to have such an ambitious dream, and how the whole thing came together despite so many duplicitous forces working against them. Spliced together with archival footage, shadowy B-roll, and ominous music, we get quotes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3CsecQcCcQ&amp;t=0s&amp;index=7&amp;list=PLS9k2JdaexI0SXrt6DI9jGAD1m7nJQIrv\">like</a>, “There were times where I wasn’t sure we were going to [be able to make it happen]” and “I didn’t really believe it could get done.” If you didn’t know what they were talking about, you could be forgiven for thinking this was the inside story re: how a group of soccer players was rescued from a cave in Thailand.</p>\n<p>Of course, nowhere in the near-20-minute homage to Ryan’s ego&#8212;which Wisconsin’s First Son promoted with a tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpeakerRyan/status/1074641093533360128\">claiming</a> he’s “been fighting for comprehensive tax reform“ since the day he arrived in Washington&#8212;was there any mention of the fact that Ryan didn’t actually reform anything, settling instead for $1.5 trillion worth of tax cuts that will add to the massive debt he’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/11/29/18118216/paul-ryan-regrets-immigration-debt\">supposedly broken up about failing to tackle</a>, and do <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/03/28/entirely-predictable-most-americans-say-they-are-not-seeing-paycheck-boost-gop-tax\">basically nothing</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/12/18/18146253/tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-stock-market-economy\">for the working class</a>.

Bank of America and UBS led the deal for Alaska, but the S.E.C. did not name either the investment banker’s employer or Cho’s accounting firm in its complaint. Bank of America declined to comment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cho’s wife&#8212;his fiancée at the time&#8212;spent long hours on the deal, working nights and weekends in the one-bedroom Manhattan apartment the couple shared, as well as on vacation, the S.E.C. said in the complaint. The agency alleged that as the deal progressed, Cho used what he heard from her work to buy various call options for $4,124.49, eventually making $251,386.19 in profit. On multiple days, Cho’s trading made up 100 percent of the daily trading volume in Virgin stock, the S.E.C. said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In settling the suit, Cho did not admit to or deny the charges but agreed to pay back the money he earned with interest plus a penalty, coming to a total of $532,777. He also agreed not to violate the S.E.C.’s fraud rules again, which may or may not be of comfort to his wife.</p>\n<p><strong>The Fed has not-great news for Donald Trump</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/19/trump-reacts-to-federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision.html\">Make America Eh Again</a>?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Federal Reserve on Wednesday reinforced the notion that U.S. economic growth will likely slow as President Donald Trump’s 2020 re-election bid approaches.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While the central bank did not raise fears about an imminent recession, it projected a weaker economy in 2019 than Trump has grown used to this year.

","familyName":"Clinton","bio":"A random collection of Americans surveyed by Gallup selected Hillary Clinton as the most admired woman in the country at the end of 2015. The choice made sense. Clinton was the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, traversing battleground states to shore up voters and delegates and sell the exact kinds of qualities that would make someone among Americans’ most respected people. That this was the 20th time that Clinton topped the list&#8212;since 1993&#8212;is a testament to the role she has played in the modern fabric of American politics. (Only Eleanor Roosevelt, with 13 years atop the list, and Margaret Thatcher, who bested the rest six times, come close to Clinton’s Gallup reign.)\n<p>To be sure, there are a good many Americans who do not feel such affection for Clinton. As First Lady for eight years, she forgave her husband, Bill, for cheating with an intern, covering up the affair, and being impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice. After the Clintons left the White House for New York, she voted in favor of the Iraq war&#8212;a decision that has since raised questions about her hawkish judgement. She lost her 2008 bid for the White House, which some assumed she’d win handily, to a first-term community organizer turned senator from Chicago.

To hear the press tell it, she was “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/well-id-like-to-be-president-hillary-clinton-sends-mixed-signals-on-a-2020-white-house-bid/2018/10/29/d17257a0-db6c-11e8-85df-7a6b4d25cfbb_story.html\">sending mixed signals</a>,” and “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/413572-hillary-clinton-leaves-door-open-for-2020-run-id-like-to-be-president\">leaving the door open</a>,” characterizations Swisher herself <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1056924474367533059\">took issue with</a>. Yet for some reason, rumors continue to swirl around Clinton, inspired by an errant word from a longtime adviser <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/10/19/hillary-clinton-democrats-go-away-2018-2020-221608\">here</a>, a trolling <em>Wall Street Journal</em> op-ed <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-will-run-again-1541963599?ns=prod/accounts-wsj\">there</a>. Most recently, CNN’s <strong>Jeff Zeleny</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/27/politics/inside-politics-forecast-cnntv/index.html\">reported</a> on that Clinton was once again floating a candidacy to her friends: “[S]he was telling people that look, given all this news from the indictments, particularly the <strong>Roger Stone</strong> indictment, she talked to several people, saying ‘look, I’m not closing the doors to this,’” he said, adding that other associates still were dubious. (Said one: “it would surprise me greatly if she actually did it.”)</p>\n<p>This, said <strong>John Podesta,</strong> Clinton’s 2016 campaign manager, is nonsense. “Look, first of all, I love her, I wish she was president, she got 3 million more votes than <strong>Donald Trump</strong> did, she would have been a great president,” he <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2020-presidential-election-hillary-clinton-not-running-podesta-070ef325-dd68-480e-98ea-99ebd619d047.html\">said</a> on CNN Tuesday. “But she says she’s not running for president.”</p>\n<p>“I take her at her word,” he continued, adding that the Democratic Party has “got a lot of great candidates out there right now, and I think the Democratic primary”&#8212;already a crowded affair&#8212;”is going to be a spirited one with a lot of great ideas coming forward.” He dismissed the narrative that Clinton was mulling another presidential run as “media catnip.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, there seems to be something irresistible to the media in the idea of Clinton resurfacing. Perhaps it’s simply difficult to imagine that arguably the most qualified candidate to ever run for president is content at the prospect of spending her days <a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/deals/gl-lnc-the-clintons-la-2019\">selling speaking tour tickets on Groupon</a>, or even, as Podesta described, visiting Puerto Rico to “help the people that Donald Trump has abandoned” as the island recovers from Hurricane Maria. Whatever the reason, each new story in the genre is met with an inevitable backlash. The response to the <em>Journal</em> op-ed is a prime example: “Please, Hillary, Don’t Do It,” two CNN contributors <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/opinions/hillary-2020-prospect-opinion-honan-wierson/index.html\">wrote in panicked response</a>, while <strong>Chris Cilizza</strong> devoted <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T9hcFrD6Ns\">six-and-a-half minutes</a> to calling it a “terrible idea,” and <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/11/no-hillary-clinton-wont-be-the-2020-democratic-nominee.html\">countless</a> <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/a-request-to-mark-penn-andy-stein-and-any-other-so-called-democrats-talking-up-clinton-2020-respectfully-shut-up\">hot</a> <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/807216/hillary-2020-cannot-serious\">takes</a> <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/418137-foxs-pirro-to-clinton-on-2020-the-only-place-that-you-need-to-run-is-back-into\">emerged</a> panning possibility. (The one exception was Trump White House adviser <strong>Kellyanne Conway,</strong> who tweeted: <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/conway-jokes-about-prediction-hillary-clinton-will-run-again-in-2020-1.6640531\">“Dear God, please, yes.”</a>)</p>\n<p>But the myth of Clinton as leader-in-exile will persist as long as she remains a public figure, buoyed both by people who believe she would’ve won in 2016 save for a few targeted Russian hacks, and by those who see rumors about her potential run as a characteristic display of unalloyed ambition and hubris. The Clinton persona has become symbolic of the rift in the Democratic Party that paved the way for Trumpism, and rumors of her return are all but guaranteed to trigger meltdowns.</p>\n<h3>More Great

He has nearly unparalleled name recognition, raised nearly <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/20/politics/bernie-sanders-2020-24-hour-fundraising-6-million/index.html\">$6 million within 24 hours of announcing</a> his White House bid, and enjoys a sizable <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/february_2019/in_a_growing_2020_field_dems_see_sanders_among_most_viable_contenders_so_far\">polling lead</a> over several top rivals. Of course, front-runner status also makes Sanders a target&#8212;and there’s no shortage of opposition research his detractors are happy to surface. Last month, a group supporting <strong>Beto O’Rourke</strong> released a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/video-of-shirtless-bernie-sanders-singing-in-the-soviet-union-in-1988-pushed-by-pro-beto-group\">video</a> of Sanders during a trip to the Soviet Union, drinking and shirtless, singing the Woody Guthrie song “This Land Is Your Land.” More recently, a video has been recirculated in which Sanders, after returning from the Evil Empire, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vintage-bernie-footage-shows-now-presidential-candidate-praising-breadlines-communist-nations\">praises</a> the U.S.S.R.’s breadlines.</p>\n<p>Few, however, have been as vocal, or as snippy, as <strong>Hillary Clinton’s</strong> former supporters, who took the time to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/25/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-private-jet-flights-1182793\">tell Politico</a> that they just cannot stomach the Vermont senator’s hypocrisy. Why? For having the audacity to request the use of a (carbon-spewing) private jet so that he could crisscross the country campaigning for <em>her.</em></p>\n<p>Team Clinton’s criticism rests on Sanders’s anti-fossil fuel agenda, which in some respects is <a href=\"https://grist.org/article/bernie-sanders-the-godfather-of-the-green-new-deal-announces-presidential-run/\">even more ambitious</a> than <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s</strong> Green New Deal (which seeks to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/8/18215774/green-new-deal-high-speed-train-air-travel\">reduce air travel</a> by investing in high-speed rail). While bashing environmentalists for their travel habits is a time-tested practice, one rarely hears it from a liberal to attack a fellow liberal&#8212;unless, of course, it’s Clinton supporters feasting on old sour grapes. “I’m not shocked that while thousands of volunteers braved the heat and cold to knock on doors until their fingers bled in a desperate effort to stop <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> his Royal Majesty King Bernie Sanders would only deign to leave his plush D.C. office or his brand-new second home on the lake if he was flown around on a cushy private jet like a billionaire master of the universe,” said Clinton’s former director of rapid response, <strong>Zac Petkanas.</strong></p>\n<p>Others were less eager to put their names on the record, but took potshots nonetheless:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In 2016, after Sanders endorsed Clinton and agreed to campaign on her behalf, the Sanders campaign’s preferred mode of travel quickly emerged as a point of tension, according to six former Clinton campaign staffers and another source familiar with the travel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Those who had worked on his primary campaign made it known that the only logistical way Sanders could adhere to the event schedules requested by the Clinton campaign was by flying private. The Clinton campaign, however, viewed the private jet flights as a needless extravagance and wanted the senator to mostly fly commercial.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The senator ended up flying private on three separate multi-day trips in the last two months of the campaign.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sanders’s flights&#8212;usually on a Gulfstream plane&#8212;cost the Clinton-Kaine campaign at least $100,000 in total, according to three people familiar with the cost of the air travel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We would try to fight it as much as possible because of cost and availability of planes, but they would request [a jet] every time,” one of those sources said. “We would always try to push for commercial. . . . At the campaign, you’re constantly trying to save like 25 cents.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In total, Sanders’s flights cost a fraction of the $15.9 million the Clinton campaign spent on charter jet travel&#8212;not just for the Clintons and running-mate <strong>Tim Kaine,</strong> but also for <strong>Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Katy Perry,</strong> and several other celebrities, and the press corps traveling with the campaign.</p>\n<p>Sanders was reportedly the only politician who got private charter flights paid by the campaign, but his schedule was possibly the most grueling: a Sanders spokeswoman told Politico that he traveled to 39 rallies in 13 states during the final three months of the election cycle, and hit up 17 rallies in 11 states during the final week of the election. “[A]t no point did I ever say ‘he has to have a private plane for the sake of having a private plane,’” added former deputy campaign manager <strong>Rania Batrice.</strong> “The requests for a charter only came after the schedules were put in front of us. If a less rigorous schedule were put in front of us, we wouldn’t have needed a charter and that would have been fine for everyone involved, including Bernie.”</p>\n<p>One would imagine that Team Clinton would be far less bitter with Bernie’s “billionaire master” travel if they had asked him to travel more to, say, states that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-pennsylvania-michigan-wisconsin-what-happened-2017-9\">cost Clinton the election</a>. But bitter they are, and bitter they shall remain, to the chagrin of Team Bernie. “You can see why she’s one of the most disliked politicians in America. She’s not nice. Her people are not nice,” Sanders’s 2016 campaign spokesman, <strong>Michael Briggs,</strong> said. “He busted his tail to fly all over the country to talk about why it made sense to elect Hillary Clinton and the thanks that [we] get is this kind of petty stupid sniping a couple years after the fact. . . . It doesn’t make me feel good to feel this way but they’re some of the biggest assholes in American politics.”</p>\n<p>Sanders, for his part, appears to want a cease-fire. “Remember that our struggle is bigger than a Tweet or a Facebook comment. And remember that our primary opponents are decent people&#8212;many have been friends and allies of mine in the Senate,” <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-email-surrogates-respectfully-engage-bullying_n_5c72188fe4b03cfdaa55e866\">he urged in a recent e-mail</a> to his surrogates, encouraging them to avoid any bullying. “Our number one priority is defeating Donald Trump. To do so, we will ultimately have to unite with those who today are our opponents for the Democratic nomination. We won’t always agree with them, but I expect those who speak on behalf of my campaign to always engage respectfully.” If any surrogates need an example of what not to do, Clinton’s team is ready to offer several case studies.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; A Republican <a

Is the great unwritten story of Russian collusion hiding in plain sight?","body":"<section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p><strong>Robert Mueller</strong> is nothing if not deliberate. When he was investigating the N.F.L.’s handling of the <strong>Ray Rice</strong> domestic-violence scandal in 2014, Mueller accounted for each of the 1,583 telephone calls made to and from the league’s headquarters during the time period relevant to his probe. As <em>Wired</em>’s <strong>Garrett M. Graff</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/mueller-russia-probe-trump-wrap-up-scenarios/\">recently noted</a>, however, Mueller’s conclusions were frustratingly narrow. Despite trawling a sea of data&#8212;5 pages of his 96-page report were dedicated to the N.F.L. mail room’s procedures&#8212;Mueller refused to issue a conclusion about the the culture of the N.F.L., its pursuit of justice, or its long suspected inclination to manage its largest crises with a lack of transparency. Instead, he focused narrowly on the precise case in front of him. Now, with Mueller expected to turn over his confidential findings in the Russia investigation to Attorney General <strong>William Barr</strong> in the impending weeks, some wonder whether the special counsel will remain similarly disciplined, or if he will widen his aperture. (A judge dismissed <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2015/05/21/judge-dismissed-domestic-violence-charges-against-ray-rice/27709875/\">domestic-violence charges against Rice</a>.)</p>\n<p>Clues abound. Mueller may indeed be writing his report in plain sight before our very eyes. As <em>The Washington Post</em>’s <strong>Philip Bump</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/02/22/slowly-written-mueller-report-thats-sitting-plain-sight/?utm_term=.9b3a78e8347a\">noted</a> last week, his team has already composed and released nearly 300 pages of plea deals, indictments, and shadowy details regarding the behavior of Trump grifters like <strong>Paul Manafort,</strong> <strong>Rick Gates,</strong> and <strong>George Papadopoulos.</strong> The details have often been scintillating, in part, because Mueller has generally employed in his filings a litany of “speaking indictments”&#8212;a colloquial term that is applied when a prosecutor offers greater detail than necessary to prove their charges. In his <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download\">indictment</a> of the Internet Research Agency, the Russian troll farm behind the 2016 election disinformation effort, Mueller included the details of a hoax that Russian operatives played on an unwitting U.S. citizen. In his subsequent <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download\">indictment</a> of 12 G.R.U. intelligence officers, he detailed with remarkable specificity their Internet searches during one 37-minute window. Perhaps the most curious detail comes elsewhere in the G.R.U. indictment, when Mueller notes how one particular spear-phishing attempt aimed at the <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> campaign was both a “first time” effort, and conducted “after hours.” These may seem like bread crumbs to a popular audience, but they’re more significant Morse-code tappings to jurisprudential scholars, suggesting that the hackers’ strategy could have shifted at a crucial moment.</p>\n<p>Mueller may be deliberate, but he’s not necessarily straightforward. As his investigation appears to draw to a close, the key to understanding his intentions relies not only on examining the information he has included in previous filings, but also upon considering the information that he appears to have <em>omitted,</em> or redacted, from them. Mueller’s 24-page indictment of <strong>Roger Stone,</strong> issued in January, revealed that the self-described dirty trickster encouraged radio host <strong>Randy Credico</strong> “to do a ‘Frank Pentangeli’”&#8212;a reference to a character in <em>The Godfather: Part II,</em> who lied to Congress only after his mobster brother showed up in the courtroom. But Mueller, the former Marine, also included numerous vagaries in the document. He outlined a series of cases where Stone was in contact with Trump campaign officials about WikiLeaks’ plans to release stolen e-mails, but did not identify said officials, in accordance with D.O.J. policy. Resultantly, we are left guessing the identity of the person who “directed” an unnamed “senior Trump campaign official “to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information [WikiLeaks] had regarding the Clinton Campaign.” In the end, the filing prompted nearly as many questions as it answered.</p>\n<p>Mueller also dedicated much of the January indictment to unraveling the various lies that Stone told about his contacts with Credico, WikiLeaks founder <strong>Julian Assange,</strong> and conspiracy theorist <strong>Jerome Corsi.</strong> But the special counsel did not explicitly say whether Stone, Credico, or Corsi were ever actually in contact with WikiLeaks or Assange about the stolen e-mails. In a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/15/politics/roger-stone-wikileaks/index.html\">court filing</a> three weeks later, Mueller at least partially addressed this issue. After previously describing Stone’s attempts to contact Assange through hapless go-betweens, the special counsel’s team said for the first time that it “obtained and executed dozens of search warrants on various accounts used to facilitate the transfer of stolen documents for release, as well as to discuss the timing and promotion of their release.” Consequently, prosecutors wrote, “Several of those search warrants were executed on accounts that contained Stone’s communications with Guccifer 2.0”&#8212;the Russian entity that hacked the Democratic National Committee&#8212;“and with Organization 1,” a.k.a. WikiLeaks. In other words, Mueller has the receipts when it comes to Stone’s contacts with Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks. What is unclear is the substance of these contacts, and whether they are limited to what is publicly known.</p>\n<p>What knowledge did Stone have about the Russian hacking operation and WikiLeaks’ e-mail dumps? Did he share it with the Trump campaign? Mueller is vague about the timing of the Russians’ September 2016 hack, when they successfully gained access to D.N.C. computers, and whether it is related to a Twitter exchange between Stone and Guccifer 2.0 that same month. Nor does Mueller explain what prompted that first spear-phishing attempt on or about July 27, 2016, the same day that Trump called on Russia to hack Clinton’s e-mails. (“Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing.”) Between the plain text of his filings, however, lie indications that Mueller may have these answers. If you re-read charging documents from the special counsel’s office&#8212;both what has been included and what hasn’t&#8212;the series of outcomes narrows considerably. These are the known unknowns of the Mueller probe. And while there may not be any one smoking gun in the Russia investigation, it could become a mushroom cloud left for Congress to litigate.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>The White House has taken comfort in the fact that among the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/20/17031772/mueller-indictments-grand-jury\">37 people and three companies</a> that have been publicly indicted or pleaded guilty in the Mueller probe, not a single Trump associate has been indicted for anything involving a conspiracy to rig the 2016 election or conspire with a foreign government. Indeed, most of the crimes have been so-called process crimes, like lying to the F.B.I. But for those familiar with Mueller’s career&#8212;as assistant attorney general for the D.O.J.’s criminal division, as a U.S. attorney in Boston and San Francisco, and later as director of the F.B.I.&#8212;these charges are a hallmark of Mueller’s approach to flipping criminals, such as when he cut a deal with <strong>Salvatore “Sammy the Bull” Gravano</strong> to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/12/how-scared-should-trump-be-of-mueller-ask-john-gotti-or-sammy-the-bull\">bring down the Gambino criminal family</a> in the early 1990s.</p>\n<p>That strategy isn’t lost on some Trump allies. “This investigation is a classic Gambino-style roll-up,” a source close to the White House <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-long-winter-white-house-aides-divided-over-scope-risks-of-russia-probe/2017/11/19/497557c0-cbba-11e7-b244-2d22ac912500_story.html\">observed</a> in November 2017, as the probe was heating up. This approach has also created immense political uncertainty surrounding the outcome of his final report. In the G.R.U. indictment, for instance, prosecutors for the special counsel’s office wrote that Russian intelligence officers “knowingly and intentionally conspired with each other, and with persons known and unknown to the Grand Jury” in order to interfere with the 2016 election. Does the fact that Mueller hasn’t charged those “known and unknown” people mean that he can’t make his case, or that he’s just been working his way up the food chain?</p>\n<p>Untruth is endemic to Trumpworld, but the frequency and brazenness of the lies told about Russia strongly suggest that Mueller’s past indictments form the building blocks of a broader conspiracy. Take, for example, the case of Trump’s former national-security adviser <strong>Mike Flynn.</strong> In December 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to a single count of lying to the F.B.I. about his contact with the Russian ambassador during the transition. Flynn’s sentencing memo was one of Mueller’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/robert-mueller-mike-flynn-sentencing-memo\">more frustrating court filings</a>. The document notes that the national-security adviser provided “substantial assistance” to the Justice Department during 19 interviews. It also notes specifically that “the defendant provided firsthand information about the content and context of interactions between the transition team and Russian government officials.” The precise details, however, were redacted entirely. Even more mysterious, in December a federal judge <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/robert-mueller-mike-flynn-sentencing\">postponed sentencing Flynn</a>&#8212;Mueller had recommended zero to six months in prison&#8212;so that Flynn might continue cooperating with prosecutors.</p>\n<p>Then you have <strong>Michael Cohen,</strong> the president’s longtime personal attorney and fixer, whose case Mueller handed off to the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York. In August, Cohen pleaded guilty to crimes including campaign-finance violations stemming from hush-money payments made to two women. In November, Cohen also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/michael-cohen-trumps-former-lawyer-pleads-guilty-to-lying-to-congress/2018/11/29/5fac986a-f3e0-11e8-bc79-68604ed88993_story.html\">pleaded guilty</a> to lying to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project, which Trump&#8212;the infamous “Individual 1” in the S.D.N.Y.’s case&#8212;pursued well into 2016 election. Cohen told the court that he lied about the end of Trump Tower negotiations “to be consistent with Individual 1’s political messaging and out of loyalty to Individual 1.” As a reward for his cooperation, Mueller recommended that Cohen receive no additional jail time beyond the recommendation of the S.D.N.Y., although he was ultimately sentenced by a federal judge to three years in prison.</p>\n<p>Manafort’s own aborted cooperation agreement with the special counsel provides yet another window into Mueller’s strategy&#8212;and, potentially, into whatever conspiracy he may be hoping to uncover. Thanks to a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/manafort-accidentally-suggests-he-gave-polling-data-to-russia\">botched redaction</a>, we learned that the special counsel accused Manafort of breaching his cooperation agreement by, among other things, lying about contacts with the Trump administration after the election, as well as discussing a Ukrainian “peace plan” and sharing private polling data with <strong>Konstantin Kilimnik,</strong> a suspected Russian intelligence agent. In a hearing to discuss the breached agreement, defense attorney <strong>Richard Westling</strong> argued that Manafort’s lies were only related to a “small set” of topics. “Many of the more sensitive topics that we’re aware of from a&#8212;all of us paying attention to what’s gone in the news cycle over the last many months, you know, are things where these issues didn’t come up, where there wasn’t a complaint about the information Mr. Manafort provided,” he said, suggesting his client may have supplied useful information to Mueller that has yet to be made public.</p>\n<p>In her ruling on the matter, U.S. District Judge <strong>Amy Berman Jackson</strong> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000168-f3e2-d418-a57b-f3f796ca0001\">said</a> that Manafort’s behavior, especially pertaining to his interactions with Kilimnik, was “at the undisputed core of the Office of Special Counsel’s investigation” into whether any Trump campaign officials coordinated with the Russians to derail Clinton’s candidacy. “Mr. Kilimnik doesn’t have to be in the government, or even be an active spy to be a link,” she said. Nor was Jackson convinced that Manafort’s inaccurate statements were unintentional. Over and over, she said, Manafort’s lies revolved around “Kilimnik, Kilimnik, and Kilimnik.” (Mueller <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/document-special-counsel-files-manafort-sentencing-memo\">previously estimated</a> that Manafort could receive between 19 and 24 years in prison, based on sentencing guidelines. Prosecutors have <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5731934-USA-v-Manafort-2-4-19-Hearing-Redacted-Transcript.html\">argued</a> that Manafort lied, at least in part, to “augment his chances for a pardon.”)</p>\n<p>And then there’s the perplexing, and still unexplained, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/02/politics/trump-lawyers-statement-trump-tower-russians/index.html\">role</a> the president played in crafting the misleading statement to <em>The New York Times</em> about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting attended by <strong>Donald Trump Jr.,</strong> <strong>Jared Kushner,</strong> Manafort, and a group of Kremlin-linked Russians. The initial statement, dictated by Trump, said the primary purpose of the meeting with to discuss “a program about the adoption of Russian children”&#8212;the same subject that Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/us/politics/trump-interview-sessions-russia.html\">said</a> he and <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> discussed when they huddled on the sidelines of the G20 summit in July 2017. Of course, later it was revealed that Don Jr. was lured by the promise of Russian government “dirt” on Clinton.</p>\n<p>Critics of the Mueller probe argue that such misstatements were accidental or trivial, and that the special counsel’s office is abusing its power by prosecuting lies. But in nearly every case, the topic is the same: Russia. If Flynn’s conversations with then-Russian ambassador <strong>Sergey Kislyak</strong> were standard fare during a presidential transition, why did he lie to the F.B.I. and multiple administration officials, including <strong>Mike Pence,</strong> about them? If Trump’s dealings with Russia to build Trump Tower Moscow were appropriate, why did he and Cohen lie about them for more than two years? Why did the president issue a misleading statement on the Trump Tower meeting if it was all aboveboard? If Stone had nothing to hide about his interactions with Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks, then why did he lie about them to Congress and go so far as to threaten to steal Credico’s therapy dog? Why did Papadopoulos lie about the <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/800354d636af47f3afbd19338a377887\">mysterious Maltese professor</a> who told him about the Clinton “dirt”? And why would Manafort breach his cooperation deal with Mueller, risking the rest of his life behind bars, to conceal his interactions with Kilimnik?</p>\n<p>Throughout the Russia investigation, Mueller has been unsparing in drilling down to the details in his indictments. And yet, all of these omissions go to the heart of the collusion question. It’s safe to assume that Mueller has the answers, and then some&#8212;he has merely chosen not to share them yet. In order to catch all these Trump associates in their lies, Mueller must know the truth. There is the possibility that the special counsel will unveil these answers in a broad conspiracy indictment. Or he could package all the evidence and testimony gathered in the jury process&#8212;sans analysis or judgment&#8212;and drop the whole thing at the feet of House Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi,</strong> just as Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski did when he sent lawmakers a 55-page grand-jury report known as the “Road Map.” Anyone who looks could see the dots. All that’s left would be to connect them.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>As the White House has pointed out following each of Mueller’s indictments, neither the president nor his deputies have been charged with taking part in a foreign conspiracy to illegally influence the 2016 election. At least not yet. Trump himself is almost certainly immune to prosecution while he is president, according to long-standing Justice Department guidelines. But that doesn’t mean Mueller isn’t building a case that he can effectively turn over to Congress, which has the power to impeach Trump. As <strong>Asha Rangappa,</strong> a former F.B.I. counter-intelligence agent who worked under Mueller, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/donald-trump-michael-cohen-trump-tower-russia\">explained to me</a> last year, “Collusion does not necessarily have to be criminal.” The definition of collusion, she continued, could be as simple as “secretly conspiring or working with a foreign power to help them in their covert operation.”</p>\n<p>Trump’s lawyers have recognized this. For months, the official position of the Trump White House was that there was “no collusion.” More recently, however, the president’s lawyers have shifted the goalposts. “If Roger Stone gave anybody a heads-up about WikiLeaks’ leaks, that’s not a crime,” <strong>Rudy Giuliani</strong> <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/giuliani-almost-admits-trump-collusion-crime-wikileaks-roger-stone.html\">told</a> ABC News in December, several weeks before Mueller’s indictment against Stone revealed that the longtime Trump confidant had communicated with campaign officials about WikiLeaks’ plans. “The crime is conspiracy to hack. Collusion is not a crime; it doesn’t exist.”</p>\n<p>In the realm of impeachment, collusion is indeed a political question. But whether Trump, his campaign, or his associates <em>conspired</em> with the Russians to sabotage Clinton and subvert the American electoral process is a legal one. When analyzing the public body of Mueller’s work, the litany of speaking indictments and other court documents suggest that Mueller is building toward something big. As <strong>Glenn Kirschner,</strong> a former federal prosecutor who worked closely with Mueller, posited to me last year, “It wouldn’t be a surprise if he returned a large conspiracy indictment for basically a conspiracy to defraud the United States by interfering in our elections.”</p>\n<p>With the two-year anniversary of Mueller’s appointment this spring, some of the juiciest&#8212;and arguably most consequential&#8212;questions about Russian election interference and the Trump campaign remain unanswered. But every bizarre detail or curious omission from Mueller to date could be a bread crumb leading to what the special counsel is preparing next. The investigation’s known unknowns are an investigative road map.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; A Republican <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/bill-weld-2020-republican-primary-challenge?inline\">mission to stop Trump?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Howard Schultz defends <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/howard-schultz-i-firmly-believe-americans-want-a-president-just-like-me?inline\">his controversial potential presidential bid</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The suspected leaker of Jeff Bezos’s texts has his own <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/suspected-bezos-leaker-supplies-his-own-theory-about-the-affair?inline\">theory about the affair</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Yes, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/02/kamala-harris-charlamagne-tha-god-inhaled?inline\">Kamala Harris did inhale</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The shocking details behind the double <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/abducted-in-plain-sight-netflix-jan-broberg?inline\">kidnapping of an Idaho teen</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>\n</section>","rubric":"Mueller Investigation","socialTitle":"Robert Mueller Appears After Something Really, Really Big","socialDescription":"Is the great unwritten story of Russian collusion hiding in plain sight?","seoTitle":"Mueller Appears After Something Really Big: Reading Between the Lines in Advance of the Special Counsel’s Report","seoDescription":"The trick to understanding Mueller’s intentions may lie not in his hundreds of pages of previous indictments and filings, but in the material that he has omitted from them.

But that doesn’t mean that no woman will pass it, or that disliking a certain woman stems solely from misogyny.","body":"<p>From time to time, the political press propagates a thought that, whatever its validity, dominates the discourse. It’s akin to a spontaneous combustion, and the truism it produces lasts until the next one comes along. As in: <strong>Amy Klobuchar’s</strong> two-and-a-half-minute exchange with <strong>Brett Kavanaugh</strong> about his drinking habits gave instant rise to the widespread conclusion that she should be the Democratic nominee.</p>\n<p>And no sooner had <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> entered the race in late December than the question of whether she’s “likable” was immediately interpreted as misogynistic.</p>\n<p>Warren’s talents as a campaigner were evident in her foray into Iowa during the first week of January. She’s quite skilled at drilling down to a simple, comprehensible point, usually having to do with economic justice. Her anecdotes go over well. For example, in Iowa she told the story of getting in touch with Iowa Republican Senator <strong>Chuck Grassley,</strong> and <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/bipartisan-over-the-counter-hearing-aid-legislation-to-become-law\">working with him</a> to get a bill through Congress that lowered the cost of hearing aids. (Cheers and applause.) She’s earned bragging rights for having spawned the idea&#8212;before she entered the Senate&#8212;of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to protect individuals from scams in credit cards, mortgages, and loans. The new agency was relatively successful, until the Trump administration took over and began to de-fang it.</p>\n<p>But there’s another aspect to Warren’s economic populism&#8212;one that makes her less than popular among her Senate colleagues. This friction has nothing to do with Warren being a woman in politics, or displaying political ambition&#8212;just as much of what bothered people about <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> had nothing to do with her gender. For an explanation of what it is about Warren that perturbs her colleagues, I sought out an observant former Senate Democratic aide of many years’ standing. What he said echoed comments and stories I’d heard from senators and reporters who’ve dealt with Warren. “She projects a ‘holier than thou’ attitude that her colleagues find irritating. She’s very doctrinaire. She’s somewhat ‘My way or the highway’&#8212;not as much as <strong>Bernie Sanders,</strong> but up there,” he said. “She has a moralizing to her . . . She rails against Wall Street, which may be appealing to some people, but it’s too simplistic to work as an analysis. But she’s very good at finding issues that resonate with middle Americans,” he added, citing the hearing-aid story. He went on: “She’s a little aloof; she’s strong in her convictions, unwilling to bend.”</p>\n<p>He then offered a comparison between Warren and Clinton as senators. Of Warren he said, “She’s never tried very hard to make friends there. Compare that to Hillary: She knew coming into the Senate that she was viewed by many there as the devil incarnate, and she kept her head down and worked to make friends on both sides of the aisle.”</p>\n<p>Of course, despite her best efforts, the “unlikable” tag has also been attached to Clinton. What bothered many people (women, as well as men) about Clinton was that she gave off an attitude of entitlement&#8212;the tin ear and air of superiority that led her to label half of <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> supporters “a basket of deplorables.” That misogyny dogged Clinton is without question, but some of her own personality traits were responsible for the way she was seen by a substantial segment of the public.</p>\n<p>The fact that Warren’s likability, like Clinton’s, has been questioned has led numerous observers to conclude that no woman in politics can overcome criticism based on her gender. That’s nonsense. After all, a <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/12/18/record-number-women-in-congress/\">record</a> 102 women were elected to the House of Representatives in 2018. (The previous House record was 85 women.) Republicans simply haven’t made the same effort that Democrats have to bring women into their ranks, with the <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/12/18/record-number-women-in-congress/\">result</a> that women now represent 8 percent of House Republicans, as opposed to 38 percent of the Democratic caucus. (Democrats also stressed diversity, and sought out candidates of both genders who’d served in the military.) In the Senate, midterms plus the appointment to fill the remainder of John McCain’s term, added 15 women, for a total of 25 women senators; previously, the <a href=\"http://cawp.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/resources/results_release_5bletterhead5d_1.pdf\">record</a> was 23. Two incumbent women senators lost to men on clear substantive issues. Midterms also saw women pick up gubernatorial seats, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/opinion/election-michigan-women-stabenow-whitmer.html\">four of the top statewide offices</a> in Michigan. A black woman fell just short of winning the governorship of Georgia, overtaken at least in part by the fact that her opponent was also the secretary of state who set and twisted the rules of the race. The direction is clear. A country that couldn’t see women through other than a misogynistic lens wouldn’t produce such results.</p>\n<p>Another way to look at Warren’s situation in Congress is to compare it to that of <strong>Nancy Pelosi,</strong> as House Speaker far and away the most powerful woman on Capitol Hill, if not in all of Washington. Despite the attacks on her in national politics&#8212;the right charges her with being a “San Francisco liberal,” though in fact she’s a product of the brass-knuckle politics of Baltimore, where her father was the boss-mayor&#8212;Pelosi’s colleagues don’t raise the issue of her likability. Under pressure from their Republican opponents, some Democrats running for the House for the first time pledged not to support her for Speaker (though not all of them held to this promise). But no serious challenge developed. It was clear, as she skillfully dispatched possible rivals&#8212;who said it was time for fresh blood in the Democratic leadership&#8212;that Pelosi is admired by most of the men as well as the women in the Democratic caucus for her legislative smarts and her toughness wrapped in a certain grace. Several said that Pelosi was just who was needed to deal with Donald Trump. She met the argument of those who said she should make way for younger leadership by agreeing to step down from the Speakership after four more years. The contrasting cases of Warren and Pelosi show that people&#8212;both men and women&#8212;are capable of making distinctions among women in politics.</p>\n<p>The question arises: What does likability matter in politics? Does it&#8212;should it&#8212;matter at all, if someone can get elected? In fact, it counts for a lot in determining whether a political figure can work effectively with others&#8212;whether she or he can build coalitions&#8212;or can lead the public. A politician whom large numbers of people find grating simply has a harder time leading the country. This is one reason I don’t complain about the length of presidential campaigns: It usually helps sort out who will wear well. Usually. The fact that Trump is disliked by a majority of the country has been one factor getting in the way of his possible effectiveness.</p>\n<p>It’s undeniable that, while women have been making headlong progress in politics, as well as in some other professional fields, they still carry an extra burden. The double standard still exists: A man who speaks out strongly or objects to something a male boss has done is “strong,” “tough.” A woman who does the same thing is likely to be termed “difficult.” That word, “difficult,” stated or insinuated, haunts women in the workplace. Fortunately, an increasing proportion of men have enough inner strength or are sufficiently enlightened that they deal with women the same way they do men. Sexism in the workplace and in politics may be fading, but not quickly enough.</p>\n<p>At least for a while longer, women in certain fields will endure a different kind of test than men do&#8212;or an additional one. But that doesn’t mean that no woman will pass it, that it’s the only test applied to women candidates, that people can’t make distinctions, or that disliking a certain woman stems solely from misogyny. Nor does it mean that, like men, women can’t find a female candidate wanting on other grounds.</p>\n<p>Misogyny can certainly affect women in politics, but they’ll also be judged on other factors on a case-by-case basis. Other female candidates warming up for the race warrant scrutiny for other traits.

Unlike <strong>Corey Lewandowski,</strong> who was hired to great consternation during the 2016 election cycle (and then terminated), Flores won’t simply be an ideological talking head&#8212;she’ll be playing a larger role in the editorial process. Despite a lack of journalism experience, she will <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/20/media/reliable-sources-02-19-19/\">be helping</a> to coordinate CNN’s political coverage across platforms, as well as <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/19/sessions-sarah-isgur-cnn-political-editor-1174527\">occasionally appearing on-air</a> as a political analyst, which is the more customary role for former politicians and government officials. Within the media world, she is seen as a controversial and unorthodox appointment. Moreover, Isgur apparently has a history of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/19/18231993/cnn-gop-operative-2020-election-coverage\">lambasting the mainstream media</a> on Twitter, including CNN, which she once termed the “Clinton News Network.”</p>\n<p>All of this has led to a fair amount of bafflement as to why CNN would hire her in a senior editorial role reporting to political director <strong>David Chalian.</strong> “Why CNN made this move to begin with is the deeper and more troubling question,” <strong>Margaret Sullivan</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/cnns-hiring-of-a-gop-operative-as-political-editor-is-even-worse-than-it-looks/2019/02/20/93d03fa4-350b-11e9-854a-7a14d7fec96a_story.html\">wrote</a> Wednesday in <em>The Washington Post.</em></p>\n<p>As far as how the talks came about in the first place, it appears that Isgur, as she was preparing to exit the D.O.J., wasn’t only shopping around for a media gig at CNN. Cable-news sources told me that she also passed through 30 Rock to discuss a potential role at MSNBC, where she met with top newsroom management in recent months. “She had a detailed idea of what she wanted to do,” someone with knowledge of the discussions told me. “She wanted to do something on-air combined with some sort of quasi-management, behind-the-scenes planning kind of work. I think she looked at Dave Chalian and said, I wanna do that.” A second source with direct knowledge of the talks said that such a role “was never under consideration.” This person added, “She was pitching her intimate knowledge of the Mueller probe as a selling point.” (CNN has said that Isgur will have no role in any coverage related to Mueller or the Department of Justice.) MSNBC declined to comment, and CNN didn’t immediately have a comment. Isgur didn’t immediately return an e-mail, but after this article was initially published, a source close to her provided a different characterization, saying that anything related to Mueller was always off the table in Isgur&#39;s conversations with both MSNBC and CNN.</p>\n<p>My CNN sources corroborated the general sentiment that’s been conveyed in <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/20/media/reliable-sources-02-19-19/\">other</a> news <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/cnn-staffers-demoralized-by-hiring-of-gop-operative-sarah-isgur-to-oversee-2020-coverage\">reports</a> about the episode: that journalists at the network are concerned and confused about the hire. “It’s perplexing to a lot of people,” one of them told me. But in a <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/cnn-defends-hiring-former-gop-operative-as-political-editor\">memo</a> to employees on Wednesday, three top CNN managers&#8212;Chalian, Washington bureau chief <strong>Sam Feist,</strong> and senior vice president of newsgathering <strong>Virginia Mosley</strong>&#8212;stood by the decision, saying they were “thrilled” that Isgur was joining the network next month. “With more than two dozen candidates to cover, constant coordination is needed more than ever,” they wrote.</p>\n<p>Likewise, unnamed CNN executives defended the move to <strong>Brian Stelter,</strong> the network’s chief media correspondent. “They described her [as] an exceptional person whose political experience will improve CNN’s coverage,” Stelter <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/20/media/reliable-sources-02-19-19/\">wrote</a>. “The fact is, political insiders have been joining newsrooms for decades. The executives pointed to past examples like <strong>George Stephanopoulos,</strong> who went from [the] Clinton White House to the ABC News anchor chair.” A CNN source added to me, “She is super-smart, has experience in the media, is a spokesperson who understands the media&#8212;seems like these are all good characteristics.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity

On Tuesday evening, <strong>Hillary</strong> and <strong>Bill Clinton,</strong> among a slew of other famous names, headed to the Samuel J.

But in a show of her much-discussed superhuman work ethic, she took to Twitter once the play was over. She wrote about Trump’s Oval Office address and his hopes for a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/1083029073230729218\">series of tweets</a>, disputing what she called a “ridiculous” speech.</p>\n<p>“The only border crisis we’re facing is the inhumane detention of kids that has already led to the deaths of two children,” she wrote, linking to an ActBlue charity fund.</p>\n<p>She added: “We’ve raised over $100k and counting for organizations that help families and kids at the border since the beginning of the president’s TV stunt last night. Let’s keep counteracting his lies about migrants and refugees with positive action.”</p>\n<p>Hillary also <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/the-new-congressional-class-set-a-high-style-bar\">showed support</a> for the women sworn into Congress last week, the most in United States history, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/1080941776377180160\">writing</a>, “To the women sworn in to Congress today, the most in our history: Congratulations.

Boyz II Men’s “End of the Road” spent 13 weeks at the top of the Billboard charts, teens looked to Seattle for fashion inspiration, and <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> claimed he didn’t inhale. Yes, looking back, it’s hard to believe, both the Seattle thing and the fact that a presidential hopeful admitted he tried a marijuana cigarette during his youth&#8212;but claimed the smoke never hit his lungs.</p>\n<p>That was more than a quarter-century ago. Sometimes progress looks like a heart monitor attached to a healthy human&#8212;up and back, up and back, ever forward, never changing. But here now, in 2019, a presidential hopeful can say, “Of course.” Of course she inhaled. And she can say it while laughing a lot with an incredibly popular radio host on an incredibly popular morning show.</p>\n<p>When asked Monday morning about her youthful weed consumption on <em>The Breakfast Club,</em> Senator <strong>Kamala Harris</strong> told D.J. <strong>Charlamagne tha God,</strong> “I joke about it&#8212;half my family is from Jamaica, are you kidding me?” she said, referring to her father’s relatives, near the end of her 40-minute interview. “And I inhaled,” she said, giggling. “I did inhale. It was a long time ago,” adding later, “I think it gives a lot of people joy. We need more joy in the world.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed block video row\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><iframe height=\"315\" width=\"560\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kh_wQUjeaTk\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowtransparency=\"true\"> </iframe></div></div><p>Many people in elected posts have copped to using marijuana. The brothers Bush, <strong>Al Gore,</strong> and <strong>Barack Obama</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/04/20/politics/politicians-marijuana-talk-about-getting-high-420/index.html\">are just a few</a>. Obama said at a conference for magazine editors in 2008, “When I was a kid, I inhaled frequently. That was the point.” Even human bunion <strong>Newt Gingrich</strong> has said as much: “That was a sign we were alive and in graduate school in that era [circa 1968].” Rather than just seeking “thank you for your candor” points, however, Harris is normalizing use of the drug in an effort to legalize it. In 2017, Harris backed the Marijuana Justice Act, which fellow presidential candidate Senator <strong>Cory Booker</strong> introduced.</p>\n<p>Booker himself broke some news on <em>The Breakfast Club</em> last week. When asking about whether the senator has a girlfriend, Charlamagne was able to extract the words “I got a boo” from the senator, a reference to his <a href=\"https://people.com/politics/cory-booker-says-he-has-a-girlfriend/\">secretly-not-secret girlfriend, <strong>Rosario Dawson</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The host is also credited with getting one of the most genuinely delightful interviews from <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> during her presidential campaign. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/04/18/hillary-clinton-joins-the-breakfast-club-to-talk-beyonce-hot-sauce-in-her-bag-swag/?utm_term=.8e27e77c2483\">In April 2016</a>, he playfully accused her of “pandering to black people” by claiming to carry hot sauce in her bag for years. “Is it working?” she asked.

Detective.</em>","promoDek":"What the Clintons, chickens, and Cajun caviar have to do with <em>True Detective.</em>","body":"<p>In anticipation of the Super Bowl this Sunday, HBO has dropped the latest episode of <em>True Detective</em> online a little early. You can watch Season 3, Episode 5, “If You Have Ghosts,” on HBO Go and other streaming platforms right now. But just make sure you are all caught up before you dive into the latest theory here, because it involves some very important revelations from the latest hour. You can listen to our full dive into the episode, including an interview with cast member <strong>Scoot McNairy,</strong> on the most recent episode of <em>Vanity Fair</em>’s podcast <a href=\"https://megaphone.link/PPY3889133426\"><em>Still Watching: True Detective.</em></a></p>\n<p>But if you’re not ready to listen to that or read the latest theory on whodunnit, we’ll throw up a little warning until you get a chance to watch Episode 5. But we <em>can</em> tease that this latest development will take us all the way to the White House.</p>\n<p>Half the fun of wading into the complicated <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/true-detective-season-3-timeline\">timeline</a> of <em>True Detective</em> is analyzing the theories&#8212;half-baked though they may be. Earlier in the season, we were chasing a solution that was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/true-detective-who-is-the-killer-amelia-season-3-episode-3-the-big-never\">close to home</a> for the Hays family, but now something much more complicated and juicy has emerged. Enter: Gerald Kindt.</p>\n<h2>ARKANSAS ATTORNEY GENERAL GERALD KINDT</h2>\n<p>One of the most striking scenes in Episode 5 saw Tom Purcell hunched over what is likely a recording of his adult daughter, Julie. Taken at face value, the audio is damning to Tom. Julie accuses her father of hurting Will and taking her. But what does she <em>really</em> say?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I saw him on the television. Make him leave me alone. Tell him to\nleave me alone. I know what he did. The man on TV acting like my\nfather. Where’s my brother, Will? I don’t know what he did with him.\nWe left him resting. He took me and I’m never coming back. Just leave\nme alone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All season, <em>True Detective</em> has been fond of vague pronouns as misdirect to keep the audience guessing. Up until Episode 5, Brett Woodard was referred to as “a Man” in the 1990 timeline simply so we wouldn’t be able to track who was convicted in the Purcell case in 1990. Similarly, here, Julie (if that’s who it is) seems to be talking about Tom, but she <em>could</em> be talking about someone else she saw on the TV. She only says someone is <em>acting</em> like her father. In other words, she could be talking about Gerald Kindt.</p>\n<p>Is Kindt her real father? Not necessarily. Though who knows? We know Lucy slept around, we know the rumors about when Julie was born. But Julie was tiny when she was taken and it’s unclear what she remembers about her life before 1980. More important, there have been indications that someone on the law-and-order side of things has been tampering with the case, which brings us to . . .</p>\n<h2>OFFICER HARRIS JAMES</h2>\n<p>James gets name-dropped in this episode as someone who went missing when the case was reopened in 1990, and several clues&#8212;including a suspiciously familiar ghost in Wayne’s study&#8212;indicate that perhaps Wayne and Roland had something to do with his disappearance. In fact, the show is implying they killed him&#8212;we don’t know why. Most pertinently, Harris James is the officer on the scene at the Woodard house back in 1980 who makes the connection between a bright red backpack and Will Purcell. If the Purcell evidence <em>was</em> planted at the scene in the 80s, Harris could have easily been the one to do it.</p>\n<p>We also know that a key set of fingerprints has gone missing from the case file and a mysterious someone&#8212;either a real cop or someone impersonating one&#8212;has been making inquiries around the neighborhood. It feels likely that James would be acting on the orders of someone higher up, and who better to turn up the heat than a powerful man like Gerald Kindt. One more detail about the Harris angle: in the 2015 story line, Wayne and Roland discuss the fact that Hoyt came to visit Wayne (likely) after Harris James died. Which brings us to . . .</p>\n<h2>HOYT FOODS</h2>\n<p>It’s useful to think of real-world parallels when chewing over this next part, which links Attorney General Gerald Kindt to Lucy Purcell’s old employer: Hoyt Foods. This massive company, which seems to employ many of the Arkansas locals, is a clear stand-in for the real-life Tyson Foods. Both companies are based in Arkansas and got their start with chicken. Tyson Foods has been in the news a good deal lately for <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/01/29/tyson-chicken-recall-rubber-may-contaminate-nuggets-usda-says/2717993002/\">various</a> unsavory <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/poultry-workers-denied-bathroom-breaks-wear-diapers-oxfam-report-n572806\">reasons</a>, but the company was in the news a good deal in the late 70s, 80s, and 90s for its connection to Arkansas’s real attorney general-turned-president: <strong>Bill Clinton.</strong></p>\n<p>The show has already made a few connections between Kindt and Clinton. For one, Clinton <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bypWnBR47Rk\"><em>very</em> famously appeared</a> on <em>The Phil Donahue Show</em> in 1992 and self-righteously clutched his pearls when host <strong>Phil Donahue</strong> dared question the stability of the Clinton marriage. The would-be president got thunderous applause. Kindt also makes a <em>Donahue</em> appearance.</p>\n<p>You don’t need to be an expert in all things Clinton or Arkansas to know that the politician and the state enjoyed an especially messy entanglement between politics and big business in the 80s and 90s. (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/whitewater/timeline.htm?noredirect=on\">Whitewater, anyone?</a>) Tyson Foods C.E.O. Don Tyson had a very cozy relationship with the Clintons. A 1992 <em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1992/03/22/in-arkansas-the-game-is-chicken/6244e0fa-5416-4a6a-bae8-a229b854ed98/?utm_term=.fb189aeea3eb\">Washington Post</a></em> report opened with this evocative lede: “Don Tyson kills 25 million chickens a week on his assembly lines, 10 times as many birds as there are people in Arkansas.” Further down the page: “It would be an overstatement to say that Clinton and Tyson could not have succeeded without each other&#8212;for the most part their relationship has been of mutual benefit, helping Tyson expand his operations and Clinton ascend politically.” In 1994, <em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/31/magazine/the-president-s-past.html\">The New York Times</a></em> further investigated the connection:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“[Clinton] was young and he was impressive,” Tyson recalls. “I don’t\nbelieve we ever talked about his politics; hell, he was a Democrat.”\nTyson put a modest sum of money on Clinton in his yearling race, a\ncongressional run in 1974. Although Clinton lost that election, he\nshowed excellent form, and Tyson backed him again in his successful\n1976 run for state attorney general; and again in 1978, when the\n32-year-old ran as the overwhelming favorite for governor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tyson’s support came with what appears to have been a lot of <a href=\"https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/02/02/Why-37-Year-Old-Clinton-Financial-Scandal-Still-Relevant\">leniency and kickbacks</a> from the Clinton administration and even messier entanglements including, what else, an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/18/us/top-arkansas-lawyer-helped-hillary-clinton-turn-big-profit.html\">investment scandal</a> for <strong>Hillary Clinton.</strong></p>\n<p>Before you start any silly “lock them up” chants, let’s focus back on <em>True Detective.</em> It’s safe to assume the show could easily connect the shadowy billionaire owner of Hoyt Foods with Gerald Kindt. And if he’s involved somehow, everything Hoyt has done so far to stymy both the 1980 investigation and the 1990 re-investigation makes sense. But what on earth is the motivation here?</p>\n<p>Some eagle-eyed Redditors noticed a connection between a portrait of Hoyt’s daughter and missing granddaughter in Episode 3 and a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZinAVMvdI8\">behind-the-scenes shot</a> of Devil’s Den in a video HBO released about shooting the show in Arkansas. It’s easy enough to imagine a scenario where Hoyt’s daughter&#8212;driven mad with grief over having lost her own daughter&#8212;might snatch Julie Purcell. Will would be collateral damage. Almost every investigator agrees Will’s death looked like an accident. Perhaps he cracked his head open trying to get his sister back. Perhaps Hoyt’s daughter lured Julie and Will into the woods with shiny toys, corn-husk dolls, and elaborate fantasies about being a secret princess. Perhaps this is the mysterious white woman many Arkansas locals spotted in a fancy brown car. Wouldn’t a chicken heiress drive a fancy car? But did she do it alone?</p>\n<h2>SAM WHITEHEAD</h2>\n<p>All reports of that shifty-looking white woman also mention a black man with a scar or “dead eye” along with her. When questioned about it, Sam brings up the killing line at Hoyt Foods as a likely place for someone to get injured. A one point, Wayne suggests they cross-reference the fingerprints found on the toys in the woods with the men who have been injured at Hoyt Foods. He might be onto something there. Hell, it might even be Sam himself. But that’s not all.</p>\n<h2>LUCY PURCELL</h2>\n<p>In this week’s episode, Wayne draws a connection between Lucy Purcell and the ransom note. Both use the phrase “children should laugh.” He suggests maybe she just wrote the ransom to calm Tom down and ensure he would stop worrying about Julie. But did she do that of her own accord? Out of concern for Tom? Unlikely. A compelling theory is that Lucy was somehow involved in the disappearance of the kids and that maybe, just maybe, she willingly sold them to Hoyt&#8212;her former employer. Maybe her cousin Dan helped her do it. Maybe she genuinely convinced herself that Will and Julie would have a better life with such a rich family. Certainly she didn’t think Will would die. That never seemed to be part of anyone’s plan.</p>\n<p>Did Lucy sleep with Kindt? Is he the real father? Does that embolden him to act on behalf of the Hoyt family? Oh, maybe. If we’re making real-life comparisons already, then we might as well mention “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/08/01/republicans-differ-on-whether-troopergate-remains-a-scandal-for-clinton/?utm_term=.78ccc8b75d96\">Troopergate</a>” and Bill Clinton’s particular sexual appetites when he held high office in Arkansas. In Episode 4, Amelia overhears Lucy wrapping up a call: “Don’t call,” Lucy says. “Who the fuck do you think you’re talking to, motherfucker? Huh? Hello? Hello?” She then tells Amelia that theirs was “not a happy home” (no duh) and that all she could hope for was that her kids would have a better life than she did. But that she messed that up.</p>\n<p>It’s not concrete proof by any stretch, but here’s one more piece of compelling evidence from a <a href=\"https://megaphone.link/PPY3889133426\"><em>Still Watching: True Detective</em></a> listener. Lucy, Tom, Will, and Julie Purcell all shared an unhappy home on Shoepick Lane. (The camera has lingered on that street sign more than once.) In <strong>Nic Pizzolatto’s</strong> home state of Louisiana, there’s an alternative name for bowfins, which are considered largely flavorless, “trash” fish. The Cajuns call them “choupiques,” pronounced guess how?</p>\n<p>Intriguingly, choupiques are <a href=\"https://www.houmatoday.com/entertainment/20090405/choupique-may-be-a-trash-fish-for-some-treasure-to-others\">commercially harvested</a> for their roe to produce Cajun caviar. A “trash” fish with extremely valuable eggs?

Despite efforts to project a manly ardor, the current leader of the free world spends most of his free time tweeting, calling friends, and watching Fox News. Of his <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/how-much-time-trump-spending-trump-properties-n753366\">745 days in office</a>, Trump has spent 222 days unwinding at Trump-branded properties and 168 days golfing. According to the testimony of numerous West Wing staffers, he struggles to focus in meetings, largely ignores intelligence briefings, and tunes out policy minutiae. Once, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/absolutely-out-of-control-cliff-simss-book-depicts-life-in-trumps-white-house/2019/01/21/883d2412-1d92-11e9-9145-3f74070bbdb9_story.html?utm_term=.ba9c2ccede7a\">according</a> to former White House aide <strong>Cliff Sims,</strong> Trump literally got up and wandered away while <strong>Paul Ryan</strong> was in the Oval Office attempting to explain the Republican health-care bill. While Ryan was still talking, Trump walked down the hall to his private dining room and turned on the TV.</p>\n<p>We’ve known since January 2018 that White House staffers have an official designation for these unstructured periods on Trump’s private schedule: “<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/scoop-trumps-secret-shrinking-schedule-1515364904-ab76374a-6252-4570-a804-942b3f851840.html\">Executive Time</a>.” What we didn’t know is exactly how much of the president’s average day is spent un-presidenting.</p>\n<p>In fact, “Executive Time” is far more than just a respite from the duties of the office. In perhaps the most remarkable White House leak this year, Axios on Sunday published about <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-private-schedules-leak-executive-time-34e67fbb-3af6-48df-aefb-52e02c334255.html\">three months’ worth</a> of Trump’s private daily schedules, dating back to the day after the midterm elections. They reveal that Trump has spent around 297 hours&#8212;or roughly 60 percent of his waking hours since the midterms&#8212;in “Executive Time.” For comparison, he’s only spent about 77 hours in meetings&#8212;less time than his travel (51 hours) and eating lunch (39 hours) combined.</p>\n<p>Leaks are endemic to the Trump administration, but this one has especially rattled an already paranoid White House. “If most [leaks] are involuntary manslaughter,” Sims <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/white-house-reaction-trump-private-schedules-leak-a0c23dc5-ad34-47f5-830f-1bc496398cc2.html\">told</a> Axios, “this was premeditated murder.” Morale inside the West Wing has reportedly taken a substantial hit. “What a disgraceful breach of trust to leak schedules,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/madwest45/status/1092186986486657024\">tweeted</a> <strong>Madeleine Westerhout,</strong> the White House’s director of Oval Office operations. “What these don’t show are the hundreds of calls and meetings @realDonaldTrump takes everyday.”</p>\n<p>If Trump really is taking “hundreds” of undocumented calls and meetings every day, that’s another problem entirely, at least for those who care about transparency. But it’s hard to believe Westerhout’s denial, especially when the evidence of how Trump spends his time is so obvious online. From shortly after he wakes up until mid-morning, the president’s Twitter feed is often just responses to what he is watching on Fox News. Often, there is a consistent delay between what had just aired on <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em> and a Trump tweet, suggesting that the president watches his programs on a DVR. In the evening, he returns to live-tweeting his favorite Fox hosts, or raging against an unflattering story on CNN.</p>\n<p>In stark contrast, Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-schedule-obama-bush-clinton-513c73ff-4d15-4e7a-9676-334557a894ee.html\">predecessors’ schedules</a> were fully booked. <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> was known to work <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/21/hillary-clinton-white-house_n_5360575.html\">constantly and at all hours</a>, sometimes calling aides in the middle of the night. <strong>George W. Bush</strong> began his day at 5:15 A.M., and <strong>Barack Obama</strong> would stay up until 2 A.M. reading. Trump seems to believe that nobody has ever worked harder&#8212;“[Obama] just sat in here and watched basketball all day,” Sims recalls Trump saying in the Oval Office&#8212;but his protestations appear to be little more than projection.</p>\n<p>It’s unclear whether Trump’s leaked post-midterm schedules reflect an increase or decrease in “Executive Time” over the past year, but it’s clearly information the White House didn’t want made public. The image of the 72-year-old president doddering around the White House with nothing to do for 60 percent of the time is hardly the image his campaign wants seen by the public before the next election. But this particular leak is unnerving for other reasons, too. It suggests, once again, that Trump’s inner circle is not loyal to him. It also would seem to confirm many of the other unflattering portraits of the president as incurious, disorganized, and distractible. ”Trump does review briefing materials, at least if you make it a point to have him do so,” one former senior White House official <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-white-house-meeting-preparation-eee8f937-a45d-499d-b322-acde6b50268c.html\">told Axios</a>. “But only if you talk and guide him through it as he’s reading.”</p>","rubric":"Executive Time","socialTitle":"A Huge Leak Confirms the Worst-Kept Secret of Trump’s

At the time, just a year before 9/11, pop music might have been at its creative nadir, the Billboard charts painted with a tableau of barely-remembered artists who couldn’t be bothered by political commentary: <strong>Sisqó,</strong> Creed, <strong>Rob Thomas</strong> and <strong>Santana,</strong> Savage Garden, and various musicians who wore carpenter jeans and frosted tips. Rage wasn’t playing that game. The nation was slouching toward a showdown between <strong>George W. Bush</strong> and <strong>Al Gore,</strong> two white men in suits racing to the mushy middle.</p>\n<p>With <strong>Michael Moore</strong> directing, Rage used their video to hammer Bush and Gore as two sides of the same centrist coin, a pair of incrementalist politicians beholden to a corrupt system that favored Wall Street billionaires and entrenched-power elites. Given the history that would unfold in the coming years across the Levant, it was a facile argument in hindsight. But politics at that time, before the World Trade Center fell, was defined by complacency and disinterest. Rage declared their answer to this broken system at the conclusion of their music video for “Testify”: an endorsement of <strong>Ralph Nader,</strong> the consumer-rights advocate and Green Party nominee who proclaimed that, “If you’re not turned onto politics, politics will turn on you.” Other celebrities at the time, like <strong>Susan Sarandon, Eddie Vedder,</strong> and <strong>Ben Harper,</strong> lined up behind Nader. He would go on to win 2.8 million votes, only a slice of the national count. But Nader had enough cultural buzz and disaffected supporters on the left to capture almost 100,000 votes in Florida, tipping the presidency in Bush’s direction with an assist from <strong>Pat Buchanan.</strong></p>\n<p>Almost 20 years later, another third-party spoiler has entered the presidential fray. His name is <strong>Howard Schultz,</strong> the self-made billionaire founder of Starbucks. No one, however, will be making a music video about Howard Schultz. Politicians only seep into pop culture when they inspire people, and Schultz, with his hand-gesturing boardroom speak and glaring lack of agenda, is so far only inspiring rage tweets from Democrats who don’t want him to help <strong>Donald Trump</strong> get re-elected. That isn’t stopping Schultz from moving forward. In a Medium <a href=\"https://medium.com/@Howardschultz/ourpath-9164e18bdb98\">post</a> published Tuesday, Schultz wrote that he feels “a deep responsibility and moral obligation to address Americans’ frustrations with our broken two-party system.” Despite the criticisms, he wrote, “I’m excited to keep the conversation going,” the ultimate piece of charmless corporate jargon.</p>\n<p>But Tuesday brought another piece of news that reminds us why Schultz faces such long odds if he chooses to run: the entrance of <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> into the Democratic presidential race. As Sanders and Trump demonstrated in 2016, insurgent politics today is practiced inside the contours of the two-party system, not outside of it. In an era of extreme partisanship, all of the action in American politics, the darkness and the fun alike, is taking place inside the tents of the two major parties. Whether Sanders can fully realize his presidential ambitions the second time around is an open question. But Sanders knows that as much as people loathe the two political parties, those parties also remain the two most important vehicles in the war for power and ideas in 2020. It’s an essential truth about our moment that could leave Schultz out in the cold, hoping to pay off the bouncer to get in to the party.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Given their behavior and tactics to date, Sanders and Schultz, two boys from Brooklyn, are gambling with two very different theories about politics. Both theories have their limits, but Sanders seems to have a better understanding of the state of play as the curtain rises on the 2020 presidential race. Schultz, if he runs, appears to be campaigning from the inside out, a fully-realized American power elite portraying himself as a truth-telling outsider. His media strategy from the get-go seemed the very definition of Amtrak-corridor conventional: a book tour, a <em>60 Minutes</em> interview, sit-downs with <em>Morning Joe</em> and the <em>Goop</em> podcast. None of it screamed populist. As he stepped out into the public crossfire, Schultz wasn’t talking about his rags-to-riches story or his admirable efforts to bring health care to thousands of low-wage earners. Instead, he was lashing both parties for abandoning the centrist impulses of the “silent majority”&#8212;a plurality, if anything&#8212;that was predictably silent when the Twitter mobs immediately came for his head.</p>\n<p>Schultz has a right to tell his story and deserves not to be dismissed out of hand simply because he is a billionaire. The angry question of “What have you ever done?” thrown at Schultz by the online hordes can be equally applied to any number of backbencher politicians and professional activists who are here for the re-tweets. But Schultz misfired by broaching the idea of a third-party candidacy at a time when the public is questioning the very idea of whether billionaires should exist. Those criticisms might have been blunted had he brought a big idea or two to the table. <strong>Ross Perot</strong> and Nader both had proactive agendas and passionate pet issues that defined their candidacies, which didn’t rest solely on trashing their opponents. As a consequence, both Perot and Nader managed to have an outsized impact with voters despite the electoral futility of their campaigns. Schultz, instead, has been little more than a scold, chiding the very politicians who are bringing actual ideas to the table.</p>\n<p>Schultz’s other big mistake was suggesting a third-party bid, claiming a hunger in the country for something other than the menu offerings from Democrats and Republicans. It is true that roughly a third of the country identifies as moderate, according to a recent Pew survey, suggesting a lane for Schultz (or his political consultants). But what Schultz seems not to understand is that in an era of partisan sorting, moderates, too, are choosing sides. For the most part, they are drifting into the Democratic Party, which recaptured the House of Representatives last November not because of firebrand liberals like <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,</strong> but on the backs of suburban moderates hailing from places like Orange County and central Virginia. Moderates do have power. At the moment, they’re just choosing to vote Democrat in opposition to President Trump. What’s more, the idea that registered partisans might abandon their party in the ballot box in favorite of a sensible moderate is increasingly quaint. As the political scientist <strong>Lee Drutman</strong> has written, partisan identity in the age of Trump is much more closely aligned with social and cultural identity. That lends a more intense meaning to your partisan jersey, red team or blue. Common ground is much more difficult to locate outside of the two parties. If Schultz wanted an honest hearing at a time of deep partisan divide, the Democratic primary would have been the most logical place for it. Followed, of course, by a CNN town hall.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>While Schultz runs from the inside out, Sanders seems to be reprising the strategy that almost got him to the pinnacle in 2016, running from the outside in, a people-powered ideologue gunning to take over a Democratic Party that still regards him with suspicion. The very fact that Sanders was not fully accepted into the ranks of the Democratic establishment is one source of his appeal.</p>\n<p>Sanders might be 77 years old and “salty as ever,” as CNN’s <strong>Kate Bolduan</strong> said on-air Tuesday after his announcement, but he’s still a central figure in the dialectic of the Democratic Party, its most uncompromising ideological figure, and best fund-raiser. Like Trump, Sanders didn’t get there by climbing the ladder in Washington like his fellow senators now in the presidential race; he did it by tapping into common-sense ideas about economic fairness and raising oceans of small-donor cash online in the process. He delivered his message using non-traditional media and waited for the green-room journalism crowd to catch up. A democratic socialist, Sanders might have chosen to run in 2016 as a third-party liberal in the mold of Nader. But instead, he smartly decided to disrupt the Democratic Party from the inside by seeking its presidential nomination, all while never calling himself a Democrat. Sanders became the liberal folk hero of the last campaign, the subject of graffiti murals, hipster endorsements, and D.I.Y. merch, the cool grassroots signifiers that swirled around Nader a decade and a half earlier.</p>\n<p>While Sanders lost to <strong>Hillary Clinton,</strong> his failed campaign nevertheless established his place in the political firmament. Today, as he embarks on a new race, his signature issues are now key touchstones in the Democratic primary. When his rivals tip-toe around their commitment to Medicare for all, a new minimum wage, and free college education, Sanders will be right there holding their feet to the fire. And as curmudgeonly as Sanders seems, he also likes the attention from a mainstream press that ignored him for so many decades, which is why he could barely conceal his smiles during his announcement interview with <strong>John Dickerson</strong> on <em>CBS This Morning.</em> Sanders can’t wait to go back on <em>Ellen</em> and hang out with <strong>Killer Mike.</strong> He is able to do all of these things precisely because he isn’t a creature of the Democratic establishment&#8212;because he is disruptive and refuses to play by the rules. So why not run it back in 2020?</p>\n<p>Sanders’s biggest failure in 2016 was not building coalitions. He found it difficult to expand his reach beyond liberals, white workers, and young people, to win over the older women and African-Americans who eventually gave their votes to Clinton. But on CBS, Sanders told Dickerson that unlike in 2016, he can plausibly win the nomination without cobbling together a majority of Democrats. “In some ways it makes it easier,” Sanders said. “When you’re running against one person you know you gotta have 51 percent of the votes. Now who knows what you need? Thirty, thirty-five percent?”</p>\n<p>That may come to pass: Trump slowly grew his campaign throughout the Republican primaries when many pundits expected him to top out around 25 percent. But just as Republicans don’t behave as Democrats, Democrats don’t behave as Republicans. The impulses and issue sets are different, and Sanders has yet to convince Democrats beyond his base of economic progressives that he cares deeply about the plight of immigrants, criminal-justice reform, and the white-hot cultural issues that are roiling our politics under Trump. It would be glib, though, to suggest Sanders hasn’t learned from his mistakes. He has a chance to convince Democrats he’s evolved, even if Democrats now have many more choices than they did when it was just Bernie versus Hillary all day every day.</p>\n<p>Sanders’s outsider patina gave him power in 2016 and it will again in this campaign. But he can no longer wield the element of surprise. Sanders made plenty of enemies in the Democratic Party, in and around Clinton’s campaign specifically. There are legions of well-connected Democrats who do not like Sanders and would rather he spend the rest of his days slurping down Ben &amp; Jerry’s in Burlington. They will plant negative stories about him, steer money to other candidates, puff up his rivals, and happily let him twist in the wind when he stumbles. Those things might not matter to his die-hard supporters, but every successful Democratic nominee after <strong>Jimmy Carter</strong> played nice with party insiders in pursuit of the ring. Even <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> has met with <strong>Jamie Dimon.</strong></p>\n<p>Sanders seems like he’d rather watch a 10-hour <em>Bachelor</em> marathon, <em>Clockwork Orange</em>&#8211;style, than do the same. He is permanently averse to playing the inside political game, gabbing with power brokers on the phone, or charming the media off-the-record. His sequel campaign will test whether those choices matter anymore, whether big speeches, lofty policy ideas, and social media alone can carry the day. This might be a Very <strong>Bill Simmons</strong> Hot Take, but Sanders is the <strong>James Harden</strong> of politics. He’ll get you 30 points a night, but it’s hard to see how he wins a championship without getting his teammates involved. Either way, he’ll still be in the conversation.</p>\n<p><em>Peter Hamby is the host of Snapchat’s</em> Good Luck America.</p>\n</section>","rubric":"2020","socialTitle":"The Bernie Conundrum: Can “Salty as Ever” Sanders Be a Real 2020 Player?","socialDescription":"Whether Sanders can fully realize his presidential ambitions the second time around is an open question.

Giuliani,</strong> the relationship is not without its difficulties. “Rudy hates the job,” a Republican briefed on Giuliani’s thinking <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/rudy-hates-the-job-trumps-multi-front-war-is-taking-its-toll\">told</a> my colleague <strong>Gabriel Sherman</strong> last month. “Trump is very hard to deal with.” Trump, in turn, has occasionally exploded at his personal attorney for his <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/rudy-giuliani-robert-mueller-collusion-russia\">bewildering, confessional television appearances</a>. “Trump is screaming. He’s so mad at Rudy,” a source close to the president <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/giulianis-fate-is-uncertain-after-interviews\">said</a> after Giuliani participated in a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/even-if-he-did-do-it-it-wouldnt-be-a-crime-rudy-giuliani-donald-trump-robert-mueller-moscow-buzzfeed\">rambling Q&amp;A</a> with <em>The New Yorker.</em> Several people close to Trump have suggested that he fire Giuliani before he does any more damage.</p>\n<p>These tensions have largely played out behind the scenes, in the West Wing. But on Thursday, the president addressed the latest controversy surrounding Giuliani directly. “Rudy has been wrong,” Trump claimed in his first sit-down <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/us/politics/trump-interview-transcripts.html\">interview</a> with <em>The New York Times</em> in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/us/politics/trump-interview-excerpts.html\">over a year</a>, contradicting his attorney’s shifting statements regarding efforts by the Trump Organization to build a luxury high-rise in Moscow during the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>While Giuliani has since walked back his comments about the Moscow development, his original conjecture&#8212;that Trump was involved in conversations about the real-estate project up until November 2016&#8212;created a massive political headache for the White House. In late January, Giuliani <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/us/politics/trump-tower-moscow-cohen-giuliani.html\">told the <em>Times</em></a> that the talks were “going on from the day [he] announced to the day [he] won,” then immediately told <em>Meet the Press</em> that it was an <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-january-20-2019-n960731\">“active proposal”</a> through the very end of the election.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Trump attempted to repair the damage by tossing his attorney under the bus. “So let me tell you about about Trump Tower Moscow,” he told <em>Times</em> reporters <strong>Maggie Haberman</strong> and <strong>Peter Baker,</strong> who were accompanied in the Oval Office by the paper’s publisher, <strong>A. G. Sulzberger.</strong> “This was a very unimportant deal. This was a very unimportant deal. No. 1. No. 2, this was a deal, the only thing you heard is through Rudy [Giuliani]. Is that what you heard? Through Rudy?”</p>\n<p>“More recently we heard through Rudy, he quotes you,” said Baker.</p>\n<p>Trump responded by making it exceedingly clear that Giuliani did not know what he was talking about:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rudy was incorrect. No. 1, he was incorrect, and we’ve explained that, he was wrong. Rudy has been wrong. A little bit. But what has happened is this. I didn’t care. That deal was not important. It was essentially a letter of intent or an option. I’m not even sure that they had a site. And if you look at where that was sent to, that was a Michael Cohen thing. If you look, I always say, Why don’t you bring this up, to Jay Sekulow, good guy. I think it was sent to almost like a public address for Moscow. If you take a look at it. Take a good solid look. The original letter or something was sent. They didn’t even have anybody to send it to. But that deal is just like other deals. I was doing other deals. I was running for president, but I was also running a business.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even that admission is problematic, of course. Throughout the 2016 election, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/donald-trump-russia-hillary-clinton-emails-dnc-hack\">claimed</a> that he had “nothing to do with Russia,” despite his senior campaign staff meeting with a Russian lawyer peddling dirt on <strong>Hillary Clinton,</strong> and a longtime adviser making nice with WikiLeaks. As the <em>Times</em> recently reported, there were <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/26/us/politics/trump-contacts-russians-wikileaks.html\">more than 100 contacts</a> between Trump, his associates, and Russians before the inauguration. In a string of indictments, special counsel <strong>Robert Mueller</strong> has described a vast web of interactions between people in Trump’s orbit and Russians seeking to influence the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>Given all that has come to light, the president’s narrative has shifted. Sure, his real-estate company had business with Russia during the campaign, he has said, but it was only speculative. (BuzzFeed has <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/trump-russia-cohen-moscow-tower-mueller-investigation\">reported</a> that the Trump Tower Moscow project would have netted the Trump Organization some $300 million in profit&#8212;among the most lucrative deals he might ever have made.) Where’s the crime?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TIMES: Clearly there was a hope of having money. That was the reason you were pursuing it, right?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TRUMP: My point is this&#8212;It was a free option to look at a deal, to look at deals. That was not like, “I’m going to buy a property in Moscow. I’m going to do&#8212;or I’m building a building in Moscow.” Now, I would have had every right to do a deal. That’s what I did. That’s what I did.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rudy was wrong in that he went&#8212;I think what Rudy was looking at, I think, was that in the statement I made to the Mueller group, we talked about during that period of a year, up until the election, we talked about that. So he may have been referring to that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

years before John Paulson bet against the U.S. subprime mortgage market in “the greatest trade ever,” George Soros made the “trade of the century,” betting against the British pound and earning a billion dollars in a single day. On the losing side of Soros’s wager was none other than Her Majesty’s Treasury, which lost British taxpayers more than three billion pounds on that “Black Wednesday” in September 1992. Soros, until then relatively unknown beyond investor and philanthropic circles, was bestowed overnight fame and the honor of the “Man Who Broke the Bank of England.”\n<p>But the similarities between Paulson and Soros end at their greatest trades. At age 13, after the Nazis had taken Budapest, Soros went into hiding, posing as the godson of a Ministry of Agriculture inspector, then survived the Battle of Budapest (40,000 of his neighbors didn’t). At 13, Paulson was kicking around tidy Beechhurst, Queens, selling Charms candies at a markup to his classmates and discovering the charms of capitalism.</p>\n<p>After graduation and a brief stint working as a traveling salesman for a fine goods wholesaler along the Welsh coast, Soros talked his way into a job as a clerk at the merchant bank Singer &amp; Friedlander, making his way to New York two years later. By 1970, he’d started Soros Fund Management, which would earn its lucky investors an average annual 20 percent return rate for four decades to follow. Paulson may have made more on his subprime bet ($3.7 billion) than Soros made on his British pounds wager ($1 billion), but we’ll see if Paulson can match the consistency and longevity of “the Great Speculator.”</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/06/02/5750385449ce0b0f6da47f57_hive-contributor-profile-george-soros.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"June 2, 2016 9:45 am","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Kelly Butler","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-george-soros.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-george-soros.jpg","credit":"By Taylor Hill/FilmMagic/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"575038543a46c20f6de142f9","createdAt":"June 2, 2016 9:44 am","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"June 2, 2016 9:45 am","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/george-soros","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/06/02/5750385449ce0b0f6da47f57_hive-contributor-profile-george-soros.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"June 2, 2016 9:45 am","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Kelly Butler","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-george-soros.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-george-soros.jpg","credit":"By Taylor Hill/FilmMagic/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"575038543a46c20f6de142f9","createdAt":"June 2, 2016 9:44 am","revision":2,"modifiedAt":"June 2, 2016 9:45 am","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"575038603a46c20f6de142fa","revision":0,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/george-soros"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"Why Would Prince George Say His Name Was “Archie”?","promoHed":"Why Would Prince George Say His Name Was “Archie”?","dek":"Also on this week’s episode of <em>In the Limelight:</em> Prince Harry goes on a health kick and Angelina Jolie (with her kids) sells organic dog treats.","promoDek":"Also on this week’s episode of <em>In the Limelight:</em> Prince Harry goes on a health kick and Angelina Jolie (with her kids) sells organic dog treats.","body":"<p>Imagine walking your dog, by a stream in the bucolic British countryside somewhere, and you look up to see perhaps the most famous five and three-year-old children on this globe: <strong>Prince George</strong> and <strong>Princess Charlotte.</strong> Such was the case recently when an unidentified woman <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/prince-george-potential-nickname-carole-middleton\">chanced upon</a> the two young royals (accompanied by grandmother <strong>Carole Middleton</strong>). George reportedly approached to pet the woman’s dog, and the woman, perhaps a bit flummoxed, asked a question: “What’s your name?” George’s answer was surprising&#8212;he said “Archie” (!)&#8212;and naturally launched a thousand inquiring blog posts.</p>\n<p>On this week’s episode of <em>Vanity Fair</em>’s pop-culture podcast, <em>In the Limelight,</em> co-hosts <strong>Josh Duboff</strong> and <strong>Julie Miller</strong> break down the anecdote in their usual obsessive fashion.

Per the outlet, George had been playing with his sister, three-year-old <strong>Princess Charlotte,</strong> in a stream, before approaching the stranger, a woman, who was accompanied by her dog.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6636903/Im-called-Archie-Playful-Prince-George-reveals-nickname-stunned-dogwalker.html\">the woman’s account</a>, George was in a quite amiable mood. The woman, who has remained anonymous, told <em>The Sun</em>: “I was asked by a police minder not to take a photo of the children, which I didn’t, but George started stroking my dog.” What does one do when the most famous five-year-old in the world comes up to you and your dog and starts petting the animal? Well, in this woman’s case, she&#8212;understandably unsure what to say, probably&#8212;blurted out the first question that came to mind. “Just to be friendly, I engaged in a bit of small talk, and I asked George what his name was, even though obviously I knew it,” she said.</p>\n<p>George’s response, however, was a bit surprising. She recounted, “To my astonishment, he said, ‘I’m called Archie,’ with a big smile on his face. I don’t know why he calls himself Archie, but kids often play with their names, and I think it’s lovely.”</p>\n<p>Why Archie?! As we wondered earlier, maybe George dressed as the comic-book character for Halloween last year, and this is sort of a residual “bit” he’s been doing since? The <em>Daily Mail</em> notes that George’s middle names are Alexander and Louis, so perhaps it’s possible Archie emerged as some sort of variation of Alexander? Or maybe it’s some sort of layered inside joke with Charlotte, where they pretend they’re “ordinary” kids with alternate normal lives when they come across strangers, just to amuse themselves.</p>","rubric":"Royals","socialTitle":"Has Prince George’s Unexpected Nickname Been Revealed?","socialDescription":"“I was asked by a police minder not to take a photo of the children . . . but George started stroking my dog.”\n","seoTitle":"Has Prince George’s Unexpected Nickname Been Revealed?","seoDescription":"“I was asked by a police minder not to take a photo of the children . . . but George started stroking my dog.”\n","channel":"Style","subChannel":"Royals","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","interactiveOverride":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["prince george"],"revisionAuthor":"Josh Duboff","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5c4f2207a358ac6e491890d5","revision":4,"createdAt":"January 28, 2019 10:38 am","modifiedAt":"January 28, 2019 10:41 am","revisionCreatedAt":"January 28, 2019 10:41 am","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Style","slug":"style","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11ff5bec5053bd80396","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Royals","slug":"royals","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120fc4232048726e6d0","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"prince george","slug":"prince-george","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb8117a97170b75493093","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"name":"Josh Duboff","id":"53d70c86c980f8de611b70b1","revision":16,"createdAt":"July 28, 2014 10:52 pm","modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 8:03 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 8:03 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"contributors","modelName":"contributor","publishable":true,"image":false,"identifiable":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"bio":"Josh Duboff is a VF.com senior writer, based in New York, who covers entertainment and culture.

Idris Elba! Carey Mulligan! Tom Hardy!</strong> And, of course, perhaps most glam of all: <strong>George</strong> and <strong>Amal Clooney.</strong> There had been reports that Amal and Meghan had become close, but it was not until the royal wedding that we had a sign that there was seemingly a real friendship between the couples. There were even accounts from the wedding reception that George poured his Casamigos tequila for guests and danced with Meghan at one point.</p>\n<p>And then there were <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/culture/story/prince-harry-meghan-markle-enjoy-italian-getaway-george-57304407\">reports</a> last August that Meghan and Harry spent some time at the Clooneys’ estate on Lake Como, which included some fantastic details. George apparently “showed Harry his collection of motorcycles.” Meanwhile, Amal and Meghan “spent much of their days lounging by the pool together and, of course, playing with the [Clooneys’] twins,” ABC reported at the time. George and Harry reportedly shot some hoops, too. And, but of course, the Clooneys threw “several banquets” for the Sussexes over their stay. (Yes, <em>several</em> banquets! Imagine staying with some friends for the weekend and there being just one banquet in your honor&#8212;not O.K.!)</p>\n<p>George and Amal had not publicly discussed their relationship with the royal couple until Tuesday, when George spoke about Meghan at a T.C.A. panel for his new Hulu series, <em>Catch-22.</em> According to Australian magazine <em>Who,</em> Clooney <a href=\"https://people.com/royals/george-clooney-defends-meghan-markle-talks-being-godfather-to-baby/\">compared</a> the onslaught of attention on Meghan to that of the circus surrounding Princess Diana. “They’re just chasing Meghan Markle everywhere; she’s been pursued and vilified,” he said. “She’s a woman who is seven months pregnant, and she has been pursued and vilified and chased in the same way that Diana was, and it’s history repeating itself,” adding, “We’ve seen how that ends.”</p>\n<p>In a less intense moment, Clooney was asked about the rumor circulating that he and Amal might be godparents to Harry and Meghan’s son or daughter. “Oh yes, I’ll be godfather of the royals apparently,” George joked, before quickly adding what <em>People</em> describes as an “emphatic” dismissal: “No!” He continued, “I’m a father of twins. I have enough shit to deal with&#8212;literally!”</p>\n<p>George’s defense comes about a week after a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/02/meghan-markle-friends-anonymous-speaking-out-thomas\"><em>People</em> cover story</a> in which five of Meghan’s friends&#8212;all of whom remained anonymous&#8212;spoke out on her behalf, defending her character and behavior amid what they see as “global bullying” of their friend.</p>","rubric":"Royals","socialTitle":"George Clooney Comes to His Friend Meghan Markle’s Defense","socialDescription":"The actor says the circus surrounding the Duchess of Sussex reminds him of Princess Diana.\n","seoTitle":"George Clooney Comes to His Friend Meghan Markle’s Defense","seoDescription":"The actor says the circus surrounding the Duchess of Sussex reminds him of Princess Diana.\n","channel":"Style","subChannel":"Royals","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","interactiveOverride":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["Meghan Markle","george clooney"],"revisionAuthor":"Josh Duboff","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5c62ea2e003afa5aebada1c2","revision":10,"createdAt":"February 12, 2019 10:45 am","modifiedAt":"February 12, 2019 11:18 am","revisionCreatedAt":"February 12, 2019 11:18 am","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Style","slug":"style","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11ff5bec5053bd80396","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Royals","slug":"royals","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120fc4232048726e6d0","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"Meghan Markle","slug":"meghan-markle","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7e2b7dc810b67cf6f52","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"george clooney","slug":"george-clooney","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7ec22e5400b9d092edb","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"name":"Josh Duboff","id":"53d70c86c980f8de611b70b1","revision":16,"createdAt":"July 28, 2014 10:52 pm","modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 8:03 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 8:03 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"contributors","modelName":"contributor","publishable":true,"image":false,"identifiable":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"bio":"Josh Duboff is a VF.com senior writer, based in New York, who covers entertainment and culture.

Kate Middleton and Meghan have not been seen in public together since Christmas, and there is always&#8212;particularly in the British press&#8212;a whole lot of scrutiny about the contours of their relationship.</p>\n<p>Of course, Kate was not at the shower, though reports swirled that Meghan may have a second, smaller baby shower in London, for family, which one would assume would likely be attended by Kate. The date also overlapped with the school holiday for Kate’s children, <strong>Prince George</strong> and <strong>Princess Charlotte.</strong> While the family was rumored to be on a ski vacation, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6742033/Kate-splashes-half-term-treat-Duchess-takes-George-Charlotte-swimming.html\">it turns out</a>, per the <em>Daily Mail</em>’s <strong>Rebecca English,</strong> the family was in fact spending the break at Anmer Hall, the Cambridges’s property on the <strong>Queen’s</strong> Sandringham estate.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday afternoon last week, according to the <em>Daily Mail,</em> Kate took George and Charlotte&#8212;five and three years old, respectively&#8212;to a “luxury Norfolk hotel complex.” Sounds pretty nice! And there are some surprisingly specific details about Kate’s behavior at the outing, thanks to an onlooker. She was reportedly “wearing a maroon swimsuit,” as well as “full makeup, pearl earrings, and her iconic engagement ring.” She initially “tried to blend in amongst relaxing couples,” but, unsurprisingly, the high-profile squad was quickly recognized. Kate also “organized swimming races for the children,” and they “practiced little dives off the sides.” This observation is particularly amusing: “[Kate] said, ‘Ready, steady, go,’ and did a downward chopping action in the water to indicate the start of the race.” (Yes, that’s how an informal race in a pool would . . . usually start!) They ended the trip with a visit to the sauna and steam room, for about “four or five minutes each.” (Imagine having a trip you make to the pool with your kids covered in this sort of breathless detail.)</p>\n<p>There is still much more. George and Charlotte were “impeccably behaved” at the pool. George won the races, “swimming front like a dog-paddle style, and jumping in from a squatting position [on] the side.” Charlotte was doing “sitting dives,” and she apparently repeatedly said, ‘Look, mummy&#8212;I’m diving in.’” (A nod to “Shallow,” perhaps?) This onlooker stated, “Both the children swam unaided and were super confident.” Kate, meanwhile, “looked stunning”: she had “her hair up in a butterfly type hair clip and looked extremely elegant.”</p>\n<p>Per the outlet, both George and Charlotte have returned to school Monday in London.</p>","rubric":"Royals","socialTitle":"Kate Middleton Took Her Kids on a Luxury Spa Visit","socialDescription":"Prince George and Princess Charlotte went for a swim the day before Meghan Markle was showered in New York.","seoTitle":"Kate Middleton Took Her Kids on a Luxury Spa Visit","seoDescription":"Prince George and Princess Charlotte went for a swim the day before Meghan Markle was showered in New York.","channel":"Style","subChannel":"Royals","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","interactiveOverride":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["kate middleton"],"revisionAuthor":"Josh Duboff","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5c7418c654544e5e8adca9f5","revision":5,"createdAt":"February 25, 2019 11:33 am","modifiedAt":"February 25, 2019 11:39 am","revisionCreatedAt":"February 25, 2019 11:39 am","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Style","slug":"style","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11ff5bec5053bd80396","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Royals","slug":"royals","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120fc4232048726e6d0","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"kate middleton","slug":"kate-middleton","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7e49bedd20c4002b07f","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"name":"Josh Duboff","id":"53d70c86c980f8de611b70b1","revision":16,"createdAt":"July 28, 2014 10:52 pm","modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 8:03 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 8:03 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"contributors","modelName":"contributor","publishable":true,"image":false,"identifiable":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"bio":"Josh Duboff is a VF.com senior writer, based in New York, who covers entertainment and culture.

Well, in sort of an inverse KonMari situation, the <strong>Duchess of Cambridge,</strong> for an appearance today, shared the item that sparks the most joy for her.</p>\n<p>Kate Middleton&#8212;in a green Eponine dress&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-6668983/Kate-Middleton-visits-Lavender-Primary-School-Enfield.html\">visited two London schools</a> on Tuesday to see how students were faring, in connection with Children’s Mental Health Week, run by Place2Be, a charity Kate is closely involved with. At a “Year 2” classroom at one of the schools, Kate participated in an activity where each student had to share an object that made them feel good. And&#8212;this probably shouldn’t come as much of a surprise&#8212;Kate <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/12/kate-william-george-charlotte-louis-harry-meghan-christmas-cards-portraits\">picked a photo of her family</a>, specifically the portrait used on their 2018 Christmas card, shot by <strong>Matt Porteous</strong> and featuring all three of her children.</p>\n<p>“This is a photograph of my family. These are my children and this is my husband. And my family makes me feel happy,” Kate said to the group. “And we like playing outside together and spending lots of time together as a family, and that makes me feel very happy.”</p>\n<p>Kate also divulged, according to the <em>Daily Mail</em>’s <strong>Rebecca English,</strong> that three-year-old daughter <strong>Princess Charlotte</strong> is currently a fan of olives (add this to your royal family fact book accordingly), and that she often gets both Charlotte and five-year-old <strong>Prince George</strong> to cook with her, noting they recently made “cheesy pasta” together.</p>\n<p>As if this series of appearances didn’t have enough action to sate us for the rest of the week, during one of the school visits, Kate was also greeted by a cockapoo named Herbie, the school dog. <em>People</em> <a href=\"https://people.com/royals/kate-middleton-meets-herbie-school-dog/\">offers</a> an amusingly detailed breakdown of what went down when the duchess and the dog met: “She knelt down to give him a pat, only for the pooch to put his paws on her arms to get a closer sniff. But Kate didn’t seem to mind, smiling and chatting with his student handler as Herbie poked his nose around her signature bouncy blowout.”</p>\n<p>There is (brief) video footage of this Kate-Herbie meeting, do not fret:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/RE_DailyMail/status/1092780144786395136\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RE_DailyMail/status/1092780144786395136\">https://twitter.com/RE_DailyMail/status/1092780144786395136</a></p></blockquote></div>","rubric":"Royals","socialTitle":"Kate Middleton Shares an Item That Sparks Joy for Her","socialDescription":"The Duchess of Cambridge also reveals a recent meal she prepared with George and Charlotte.\n","seoTitle":"Kate Middleton Shares an Item That Sparks Joy for Her","seoDescription":"The Duchess of Cambridge also reveals a recent meal she prepared with George and Charlotte.\n","channel":"Style","subChannel":"Royals","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","interactiveOverride":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["kate middleton"],"revisionAuthor":"Josh Duboff","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5c59ace2ba532c6650dee1bf","revision":7,"createdAt":"February 5, 2019 10:33 am","modifiedAt":"February 5, 2019 10:37 am","revisionCreatedAt":"February 5, 2019 10:37 am","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Style","slug":"style","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11ff5bec5053bd80396","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Royals","slug":"royals","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120fc4232048726e6d0","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"kate middleton","slug":"kate-middleton","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb7e49bedd20c4002b07f","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"name":"Josh Duboff","id":"53d70c86c980f8de611b70b1","revision":16,"createdAt":"July 28, 2014 10:52 pm","modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 8:03 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 8:03 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"contributors","modelName":"contributor","publishable":true,"image":false,"identifiable":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"bio":"Josh Duboff is a VF.com senior writer, based in New York, who covers entertainment and culture.

There have been rampant tabloid reports, all kinds of interviews given by her estranged father and half-sister, and the pressures of a world watching her every move. And without social media or the freedom to give interviews or speak out, she hasn’t been able to respond to the scrutiny or comment on the media circus surrounding her.</p>\n<p>Last week, however, five of her friends <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/02/meghan-markle-friends-anonymous-speaking-out-thomas\">(anonymously)</a> spoke to <em>People</em> magazine about Meghan’s 2018, addressing the various rumors and reports related to her wedding, her family, and more. On this week’s episode of <em>In the Limelight, Vanity Fair</em>’s pop-culture podcast, co-hosts <strong>Josh Duboff</strong> and <strong>Julie Miller</strong> break down every element of this royal saga. In addition, the two discuss <strong>Thomas Markle’s</strong> response to the <em>People</em> magazine story, as well as <strong>George Clooney</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/02/george-clooney-meghan-markle-defense-princess-diana\">weighing in</a> on what Meghan is going through.</p>\n<p>The pair also delve into another major, recent celebrity event: <strong>Jennifer Aniston’s</strong> 50th birthday. While there were a whole bunch of surprising guests (<strong>Keith Richards</strong>! <strong>Barbra Streisand</strong>!), there was one in particular who created quite a stir: none other than Aniston’s ex-husband, <strong>Brad Pitt.</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://player.megaphone.fm/PPY3667549833?\"><iframe height=\"\" width=\"\" src=\"https://player.megaphone.fm/PPY3667549833?\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>So put on your newsboy cap, make sure you’ve got a plentiful supply of hand warmers, and queue up this week’s episode of <em>In the Limelight.</em> Afterward, please share your thoughts, questions, and feedback with <em>In the Limelight</em> on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/inthelimelight\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/inthelimelightpod/\">Instagram</a>, and subscribe to <em>In the Limelight</em> on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/in-the-limelight/id1177555203?mt=2\">Apple Podcasts</a>.

Maybe this is the year you finally pledge to give Whole30 a shot (before Googling it and deciding there is <em>no way</em> you are doing something called “Whole30”), or perhaps you want to aim to read more books (translation: buy a bunch of books that will make for one great Instagram Story nightstand shot and then sit untouched for a few months). Given the trouble we have keeping our own resolutions, it is pretty absurd for us to come up with them for others, but we are going to do so anyway&#8212;for some of our more cherished VF.com celebrities.</p>\n<p><strong>Justin Bieber:</strong> Release some new music! Something! Anything! We’ll even take an ode to your apparent <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/01/justin-bieber-face-tattoo-grace\">new face tattoo</a>. As amusing as all of the Bieber antics are (the hotel slippers! The <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/31/entertainment/jojo-siwa-justin-bieber-apology/index.html\">social-media spats</a> with 15-year-old YouTubers! Gallivanting across the globe with <strong>Hailey Baldwin</strong>!), it’s possible to forget the great success of his recent-ish pop hits (sorry, but “Sorry” holds up quite well). It’s been a while, Justin!</p>\n<p><strong>The Markle family:</strong> Take a breather from the press circuit. At first, we understood the impulse to want to tell “your side” of the story, but, at this point, it’s the same talking points over and over again, guys. We could basically pre-write the <strong>Thomas</strong> and <strong>Samantha Markle</strong> <em>Daily Mail</em> interviews at this point with 90 percent accuracy. Unless there is a major new perspective to share, it seems you guys would have the best chance of getting a response from <strong>Meghan</strong> if you laid low for a bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Julia Roberts:</strong> Turn on your Instagram comments. This is very specific and purely selfish on our part, but we (and many others, we are sure) have been wanting to comment on your (delightful, slightly offbeat) posts, even with just a few blue hearts or a straightforward “amazing!” . . . only to be reminded that comments have been turned off on your page. (Note: that said, we understand fully not wanting to deal with the grimy underworld of Instagram comments, Julia.)</p>\n<p><strong>Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle:</strong> Without knowing what’s actually going on with you guys, what about&#8212;as a P.R. move, if nothing else&#8212;“getting caught by the paparazzi” doing something low-key and fun and sister-in-law-y? A sushi lunch? Catching a matinee of <em>Second Act</em>? Whatever. It’d do so much to quell the incessant feud rumors, which would be nice for everyone, right? It’d be months of “Kate and Meg: Leaning on Each Other” and “Double Duchess: New B.F.F.s?!” tabloid covers.</p>\n<p><strong>The Palace:</strong> Give Meghan her Instagram account back! We’ve said it before; we’ll say it again. It’ll only <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/05/give-meghan-markle-her-instagram-account-back\">result in positives</a> for you guys.</p>\n<p><strong>Ariana Grande:</strong> Sign on for a lead film role, maybe in a romantic comedy? Following the success of her “Thank U, Next” music video, in which she embodied the protagonists of four famous rom-coms, what better next move for Grande (just announced as a Coachella headliner) than starring in a romantic comedy of her own? She has the acting background for it, and could provide the genre with a needed rejuvenating spark (maybe she could be cast against <strong>Noah Centineo</strong>?).</p>\n<p><strong>Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone:</strong> Star in a buddy comedy together. Real-life friends and two of our biggest movie stars, the actresses have not worked together on a project yet, to our disappointment. We’ll even take some sort of six-episode Amazon Prime limited-series situation! (Note: yes, we realize we have now annoyingly been banging this drum <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/12/new-years-resolutions-2015-emma-watson-jennifer-lawrence-kate-middleton\">since the end of 2014</a>.)</p>\n<p><strong>Rihanna:</strong> Yeah, yeah, everyone’s on your case about releasing music, which of course we are indeed desperate for. But what about hosting a late-night show? Can’t you see it? Rihanna, glass of <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2016/07/rihanna-wine-glasses-to-go-restaurants.html\">red wine in hand</a>, her crew seated behind her? Guests would come in and chat about Netflix shows and skin-care routines? It would be perfect.</p>\n<p><strong>Timothée Chalamet and Lily-Rose Depp:</strong> You guys have the potential to be our next great “style icon” couple, the sort teenagers obsess about on Tumblr and that we’ll post throwback pictures of in 2031 with captions like, “Remember the mid-2010s?” The more looks you guys deliver, the better! Go on lots of outings in paparazzi-friendly locales, please!</p>\n<p><strong>Prince George:</strong> We know he’s gifted at language (remember his very nuanced understanding of language cues at a <a href=\"https://people.com/royals/prince-george-looks-for-daddy-in-china-cabinet-after-hearing-prince-william-is-in-china/\">very young age</a>?) and we very much hope he’s keeping a journal of some kind, with its entries ideally to be published at a later date.</p>\n<p><strong>Cardi B:</strong> Volunteer to host the Oscars. We cannot think of anyone who would excite us more in that role.</p>","rubric":"Auld Lang Syne","socialTitle":"Suggested New Year’s Resolutions for Ariana Grande, Prince George, and More","socialDescription":"What does 2019 have in store for our favorite celebrities?\n","seoTitle":"Suggested New Year’s Resolutions for Ariana Grande, Prince George, and More","seoDescription":"What does 2019 have in store for our favorite celebrities?\n","channel":"Style","subChannel":"Celebrity","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":[],"revisionAuthor":"Josh Duboff","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"interactiveOverride":"","id":"5c2fbc8beebda22d6ac445b8","revision":12,"createdAt":"January 4, 2019 3:05 pm","modifiedAt":"January 5, 2019 4:25 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"January 5, 2019 4:25 pm","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Style","slug":"style","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11ff5bec5053bd80396","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Celebrity","slug":"celebrity","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120b4f5c10202b9717c","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"name":"Josh Duboff","id":"53d70c86c980f8de611b70b1","revision":16,"createdAt":"July 28, 2014 10:52 pm","modifiedAt":"May 27, 2016 8:03 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 27, 2016 8:03 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"contributors","modelName":"contributor","publishable":true,"image":false,"identifiable":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"bio":"Josh Duboff is a VF.com senior writer, based in New York, who covers entertainment and culture.

Smells implicate us, they conjure memories (thank you brain, amygdala and hippocampus), some more emotionally captive than others, but also: home, a kitchen, cardamom. Winter’s first snow. The linen closet, cracking open a library book, summer vacations and the briny-sulfur of the sea. Some smells are “sweet as oboes,” wrote Baudelaire, or “corrupt, and rich…like amber and incense, musk, benzoin.” There’s the ambushing kind, too, the passerby who smells like an old love. Sandalwood, vetiver, plum. While our scent palette is a portal to the past, perfumes&#8212;the cloud we spritz and walk towards, anticipant&#8212;signal something different. Escape and identity. That invisible shroud that announces us or lingers like a calling card: <em>she was just here</em>.</p>\n<p>Dreary late winter is the perfect time to be transported. D.S., from D.S. &amp; Durga, offers warmth with saffron and gardenia, while Tory Burch’s Fou de Toi, inspired by the memory of powerful love, brings a different kind of heat. Papier Carbone from Ormaie, a natural brand that launched late last year, captures the scent of carbon writing paper once used in French classrooms. Chanel Les Exclusifs 1957 bestows a timeless comfort: musk, vanilla, honey.</p>\n<p>For Alessandro Michele’s latest Gucci collection, The Alchemist’s Garden, scents play games with our imagination. Leather-bound, as if meant to dust off before opening, they tell a story inspired by the rare-specific of childhood stuff. A Song for the Rose, for instance, is an ode to Michele’s mother, who “used to have a beautiful deep blue vintage perfume bottle in her bathroom, filled with rose essence.” Vivid imagery and the vague ache required for memorializing these moments is Gucci’s sweet spot, after all. But what also interests Michele is how each fragrance will be interpreted by its wearer: the personal feelings evoked, the memories both material and made-up.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Imaginary Authors characterizes their fragrances as “layered narratives,” with each scent centered on an imagined book by an author who doesn’t exist (their boxes look like books, too!). The recurring plot? What’s personal, what intoxicates, what transports. Its founder, Josh Meyer, remembers traveling to Black Forest in Germany as a child. The scent memory of the place returns to him “over and over again,” even if Meyer spends his days in Portland, Oregon, now. Coastal forests his own Proustian madeleine. Fragrances like Saint Julep (a mint field in Mississippi) or Cape Heartache (the pine resin and fog of Meyer’s Pacific Northwest) are scents that encourage the creation of personal fictions: a nudge to imagine not just what <em>has</em> been, but what might have been. What may be. A scent’s spatiotemporal power can create the unreal as well as the remembered, and to spritz on a new perfume is a transformative step for the person who might see herself as a character&#8212;who’s always known there’s more than meets the eye.</p>\n<p><strong>GUCCI the Alchemist’s Garden a Song for the Rose, $330,</strong> <a

<strong>George Clooney</strong> back to us. Hulu has released a first look at its upcoming adaptation of Joseph Heller’s <em>Catch-22</em>: a new round of photos featuring Clooney himself (taking a break from executive producing and directing), as well as <em>Girls</em> alum <strong>Christopher Abbott</strong>, <em>Friday Night Lights</em> fave <strong>Kyle Chandler,</strong> and more.</p>\n<p>Debuting in spring 2019, the six-part limited series sees Abbott playing World War II Air Force bombardier Yossarian, who wants desperately to finish his service and leave military life behind. But requirements for his discharge are continually changing, and there’s a “hilariously sinister” Catch-22 rule that prevents servicemen from citing mental health as a reason to depart. As the series’ synopsis puts it, “a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but a request to be removed from duty is evidence of sanity and therefore makes him ineligible to be relieved from duty.”</p>\n<p>In addition to Abbott’s role as Yossarian, <em>Catch-22</em> also features Chandler as Colonel Cathcart, Clooney as Scheisskopf, <em>House</em> star <strong>Hugh Laurie</strong> as Major de Coverley, as well as additional cast that includes <strong>Giancarlo Giannini</strong>, <strong>Daniel David Stewart</strong>, <strong>Rafi Gavron</strong>, <strong>Jon Rudnitsky</strong>, <strong>Tessa Ferrer</strong>, <strong>Julie Ann Emery</strong> and more. Clooney executive produces with <strong>Grant Heslov</strong> for Smokehouse Pictures, and <strong>Richard Brown</strong> and <strong>Steve Golin</strong> of Anonymous Content. <strong>Luke Davies</strong> and <strong>David Michôd</strong> co-write and executive produce, while Clooney, Heslove and <strong>Ellen Kuras</strong> each direct two episodes.</p>\n<p>For the moment, Hulu has yet to set an official premiere date beyond this coming spring. In the meantime, we’ll have to make due with these images&#8212;which show Abbott’s dreamy Yossarian, Laurie casting shade worthy of Dr. House, more of Clooney’s mustache and the ensemble cast as Yossarian’s fellow servicemen.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8211; Is this the end of <a

If it makes $115M, HBO will somehow find a way to do another one.”","body":"<p><strong>Ian McShane</strong>&#8212;former <em>Deadwood</em> star, current <em>American Gods</em> star, and forever the guy who summed up <em>Game of Thrones</em> by reminding us not to get worked up about the show, because “it’s only tits and dragons”&#8212;is teasing details from the upcoming <em>Deadwood</em> movie, which will bring him back to South Dakota as saloon and brothel proprietor Al Swearengen. When asked how the film will end, the actor also teased the possibility of a second <em>Deadwood</em> movie down the line.</p>\n<p>The original series, which ran for three seasons on HBO from 2004 to 2006, was a Western set in 1870s South Dakota; it was named for the real-life mining camp Deadwood, and characters including McShane’s Swearengen, <strong>Timothy Olyphant’s</strong> Sheriff Seth Bullock, <strong>John Hawkes’s</strong> Sol Star, and <strong>Gerald McRaney’s</strong> villainous mining mogul George Hearst were based on real people. The film will jump ahead one decade from where the series left off in its finale.</p>\n<p>At T.C.A., McShane teased the film to <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/02/deadwood-movie-ian-mcshane-spoilers-tca-1202555890/\">Deadline</a>: “<em>Deadwood</em> is celebrating South Dakota as a state, and Hearst has come back and Alma has come back in town, so you have all the main characters converging and how they changed in 10 years,” McShane said. (When we last saw George and Alma, George had forced Alma to sell her bank to him and flee the camp.) “Now Hearst wants to put telegraphs in town, which isn’t going too well,” McShane continued. “Al has had a little bit too much of that over the years. There’s a surprise for Trixie and Star.” (Trixie was one of Al’s favorite girls at his saloon/brothel the Gem; in Season 2, she entered into a relationship with Sol Star, which lasted through the end of the series.)</p>\n<p>When the show first ended back in 2006, two films were already in the works&#8212;but they never materialized, and for years it seemed they had been <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2012/03/michael-mann-david-milch-interview-luck-horses-cancellation.html\">scrapped completely</a>. Now, fans can at least rest assured they’ll get one film in spring. “It ends leaving you wondering,” McShane said of the upcoming film’s ending&#8212;adding that there is always a chance that a second movie could also see the light of day: “If it makes $115M, HBO will somehow find a way to do another one.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/the-worst-kept-secret-of-trumps-presidency?inline\">worst-kept secret</a> of Trump’s presidency</p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Silicon Valley suffocating the media? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-google-and-facebook-are-strangling-their-digital-offspring?inline\">Jill Abramson weighs in</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Bernie Sanders’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/bernie-sanders-estate-tax-billionaires?inline\">plan to eat the rich</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; The 25 <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/25-best-movie-scenes?inline\">most influential movie scenes</a> of the past 25 years</p>\n<p>&#8212; <em>Broad City</em> and the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/broad-city-millennial-rage-ilana-glazer-abbi-jacobson?inline\">pivot to millennial rage</a></p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hollywood newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"coming soon","socialTitle":"Ian McShane Teases Deadwood Movie Details, Possible Second Film","socialDescription":"“It ends leaving you wondering.

ground.","body":"<p>As much as Democrats were appalled by <strong>Ilhan Omar’s</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/opinion/ilhan-omar-antisemitism.html\">very bad tweets</a>, the outrage cycle was hijacked by the staggering chutzpah of <strong>Donald Trump.</strong> “Trump calling on a member to resign for having said offensive things&#8212;that is beyond parody,” a Democratic House aide told me Tuesday, shortly after the president said Omar should call it quits over a series of controversial social-media posts that were widely criticized as anti-Semitic. “This is a president who said neo-Nazis were ‘very fine people’ and stood by <strong>Steve King’s</strong> bigotry,” said a senior staffer to a Democrat on the committee. “There’s no reason anyone should take him seriously when it comes to denouncing hate.”</p>\n<p>Omar, a hijabi Muslim who has been fiercely critical of Israel, was already a prime target for the right after a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ilhanmn/status/269488770066313216\">2012 tweet</a> surfaced, in which Omar said, “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.” The Minnesota congresswoman apologized last month, but set off the anti-Semitism tripwire again on Sunday when she invoked the late-90s hip-hop anthem “It’s All About the Benjamins” to imply that pro-Israel members of Congress are beholden to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the powerful pro-Israel lobbying group. This time, the outcry wasn’t just from the right: Democratic leadership issued a swift and stinging rebuke, condemning Omar’s use of “anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel’s supporters” as “deeply offensive.” On Monday afternoon, Omar issued a statement in which she “unequivocally” apologized, even as she reaffirmed the “problematic role of lobbyists in our politics.”</p>\n<p>Largely satisfied with Omar’s mea culpa, Democrats want to forgive and forget. “It was a mistake. She apologized,” explained the Democratic aide. “Some people were more satisfied with her apology than others. But we can’t waste days and weeks on this, because this is totally going to distract us from our agenda if we get hung up on this infighting.” The tweet about AIPAC, this person said, was “obviously a big self-inflicted wound, but we are not going to now look at the Republicans moving the goalposts and be responsive to them.”</p>\n<p>Republicans, however, aren’t ready to move on. Aboard Air Force One on Monday evening, Trump told reporters that Omar should “be ashamed of herself.” In the White House the following day, the president upped the ante. “It’s terrible what she said, and I think she should either resign from Congress, or she should certainly resign from the House Foreign Affairs Committee,” Trump said. On Wednesday, Vice President <strong>Mike Pence</strong> followed his boss’s lead and called on Omar to resign. “At minimum,” he said, “Democratic leaders should remove her from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.”</p>\n<p>House Democratic leaders are not entertaining either idea. “Ridiculous,” a spokesperson for <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> told me Tuesday night. But after Trump helped paint the G.O.P. as the party of bigotry, Republicans seem eager to take a scalp of their own&#8212;and drive a wedge through the Democratic ranks by turning some of the party’s new rising stars into potent symbols of left-wing radicalism. “Crazy to watch what House Dems are empowering/elevating,” Congressman <strong>Lee Zeldin,</strong> who also sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/repleezeldin/status/1090390872867463177\">wrote</a> on Twitter last month, taking aim at Omar. They have also targeted Michigan Congresswoman <strong>Rashida Tlaib,</strong> a Palestinian-American, who is also critical of Israel and, like Omar, supports the Palestinian-led B.D.S. movement, which Republicans have characterized as anti-Semitic. Minority Leader <strong>Kevin McCarthy,</strong> <strong>Paul Ryan’s</strong> successor, has called on Pelosi to “take action” against Tlaib and Omar, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/mccarthy-gop-challenge-house-democrats-to-denounce-alleged-anti-semitism/2019/02/08/aef28514-2bae-11e9-b2fc-721718903bfc_story.html?utm_term=.1122797af106\">equating</a> their policy views on Israel to Steve King’s support for white supremacy.</p>\n<p>“McCarthy and Lee Zeldin have been trying to stir the pot for a couple of weeks,” the Democratic aide told me. “We haven’t really taken the bait.” Party insiders are particularly irritated given Trump’s own long history of trafficking in anti-Semitic tropes. While speaking at a forum hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition in December 2015, Trump said, “You’re not going to support me because I don’t want your money . . . You want to control your own politician.” In 2016, at the height of the presidential campaign, Trump&#8212;whose daughter, <strong>Ivanka,</strong> and grandchildren are Jewish&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/us/politics/trump-clinton-star-of-david.html\">tweeted</a> an illustration of <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> surrounded by hundred-dollar bills and a Star of David shape with the words “most corrupt candidate ever!” McCarthy’s hands aren’t clean either: in a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/28/politics/tom-steyer-mccarthy-tweet/index.html\">since-deleted tweet</a> from last October, the California congressman suggested that three Jewish billionaires&#8212;<strong>George Soros,</strong> <strong>Tom Steyer,</strong> and <strong>Michael Bloomberg</strong>&#8212;were trying to “buy” the midterm elections.</p>\n<p>“That is the exact same anti-Semitic trope that members denounced Congresswoman Omar for, and Kevin McCarthy has the nerve to say that trafficking in anti-Semitic tropes is all of a sudden unacceptable,” the Democratic aide said. “This is what their party has become. It is has become a den of conspiracy theorists and bigots and anti-Semites, or at least a place where anti-Semitic notions are not condemned and are given fertile ground.” Omar’s tweet crossed a line, Democrats say, but at least she apologized.</p>\n<p>Whether Republicans can accept that apology, too, remains to be seen. As partisanship deepens, both Republicans and Democrats are increasingly responding to racial and sexual issues in their own caucus by invoking the misdeeds of their colleagues across the aisle rather adjudicating them individually, on a moral level. It’s not clarifying to compare Ilhan’s comments to Trump’s “both sides” equivocation, just as it’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/what-democrats-can-learn-from-their-virginia-racism-mess\">unfair</a> to compare <strong>Ralph Northam</strong> and <strong>Justin Fairfax.</strong> What’s lost in it all, however, is that in our fast-twitch world we can no longer judge these instances are their own. Instead, they are considered as misdeeds along a sliding scale or spectrum, with varying political consequences.</p>\n<p>Omar, for one, says she wants to do better. Can Republicans take her at her word?</p>\n<p>“No one is perfect, but what we’ve seen is that many in the right wing have zeroed in on Reps. Omar and Tlaib, as they’ve done women of color across the board, in an attempt to silence them and delegitimize their thoughts and stances,” <strong>Denzel McCampbell,</strong> Tlaib’s communications director, told me. “Both Reps. Omar and Tlaib have shown a great willingness to listen to their critics and grow from these experiences, because they are genuinely committed to mutual respect and understanding, something that other members must be willing to do as well&#8212;and something we have yet to see from many.”</p>\n<p>Even so, Omar is on thin ice with her colleagues. “We hope that Representative Omar will learn from this moment,” the senior staffer told me. “Her position is not consistent with the rest of the Democrats on the committee.”</p>","rubric":"Democrats","socialTitle":"“Beyond Parody”: Democrats Grapple

<strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> most shocking claims about a southern border wall has proven a bit exaggerated. The president claimed in Friday’s bizarre Rose Garden presser that several of his predecessors “have told me that we should have” built a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, though he declined to name which former presidents supported it. Perhaps unsurprisingly, representatives for the Bush family and <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> have denied the allegation.</p>\n<p>“This should have been done by all of the presidents that preceded me, and they all know it,” Trump said. “Some of them have told me that we should have done it.”</p>\n<p>Clinton spokesperson <strong>Angel Ureña</strong> explicitly <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/04/trump-former-presidents-border-wall-1082562\">refuted</a> the president’s assertion, adding that the two men have “not talked since the inauguration.” Bush representative <strong>Freddy Ford</strong> said the wall has never been discussed between the two. Former president George H.W. Bush <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/george-hw-bush-dead-at-94\">died in November</a>, though it is seen as unlikely that he and Trump had any significant discussion of a wall. Trump has famously kept his distance from the Bush family in the wake of past comments and a 2016 presidential campaign rivalry with <strong>Jeb Bush.</strong> Trump did not attend the funeral of former First Lady Barbara Bush in April.</p>\n<p>That just leaves former presidents <strong>Barack Obama</strong> and <strong>Jimmy Carter,</strong> both of whom have criticized Trump’s positions on immigration. An Obama spokesperson reportedly declined comment, though Obama himself has come out against the wall on numerous occasions. Carter, like Obama, has pushed for technological advancements to strengthen U.S. border security, according to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/politics/trump-wall-shutdown.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, but not the kind of wall that Trump is seeking $5 billion to build. A senior administration official reportedly suggested that Trump was “referring to public comments his predecessors have made about the need for border security, not necessarily for a wall specifically.”</p>","rubric":"Wall Tales","socialTitle":"Former Presidents Deny Supporting Border Wall, Despite Trump Claims","socialDescription":"Neither Bush nor Clinton ever shared Trump’s desire

Steyer is sort of like John Lindsay, but a bit wealthier and without all the rioting: Exeter, Yale, Stanford, that summer job with the Mondale campaign, the Giving Pledge&#8212;the unapologetic noblesse oblige of it all.  Steyer believes in sustainable energy and affordable housing, and bestowing on his fellow humans just a sliver of the good fortune that was bestowed on him.\n<p>Given what has happened to modern politics, we now rely on people like Steyer&#8212;those who oppose the logic behind Citizens United but understand the realpolitik world of the 24/7 news cycle enough to nevertheless pump $74.3 million toward liberal candidates in the 2014 midterm election. Steyer has become well-known as a foil to the Koch Brothers, but much of this work is devoted to the realm outside politics. After making a fortune at Hellman &amp; Friedman, a San Francisco-based private equity company, Steyer has focused much of his life’s work on philanthropy. He sits on the board of trustees at Stanford University and founded NextGeneration, a nonprofit focused on climate and family policy, and NextGen Climate Action, which takes action on climate issues. In 2010, he and his wife, Kathryn, vowed to give half of their fortune away to charity.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/26/574774b30f807a3a48c6e6ff_hive-contributor-profile-tom-steyer.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 26, 2016 6:12 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-tom-steyer.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-tom-steyer.jpg","credit":"By Gary Cameron/Reuters.","_links":{},"id":"574774b3b1a9903a488276e6","createdAt":"May 26, 2016 6:12 pm","revision":3,"modifiedAt":"May 26, 2016 6:12 pm","description":"Reuters : RTR4ESLK","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/tom-steyer","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1400,"height":700,"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/26/574774b30f807a3a48c6e6ff_hive-contributor-profile-tom-steyer.jpg"}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 26, 2016 6:12 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-tom-steyer.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-tom-steyer.jpg","credit":"By Gary Cameron/Reuters.","_links":{},"id":"574774b3b1a9903a488276e6","createdAt":"May 26, 2016 6:12 pm","revision":3,"modifiedAt":"May 26, 2016 6:12 pm","description":"Reuters : RTR4ESLK","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"5744b6f255f979a31fa989cb","revision":4,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/tom-steyer"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"Liberal Billionaire Threatens to Unseat Dems Who Don’t Impeach Trump","promoHed":"Liberal Billionaire Threatens to Unseat Dems Who Don’t Impeach Trump","dek":"Tom Steyer puts away the carrot and takes up the stick.","promoDek":"Tom Steyer puts away the carrot and takes up the stick.","body":"<p>Billionaire <strong>Tom Steyer,</strong> the former hedge-fund manager turned liberal activist, has decided that donating millions of dollars to Democrats in the hope that they impeach <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is not enough. Party leadership is in no rush to pull the trigger, especially if the <strong>Robert Mueller</strong> report isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, and Democratic presidential candidates are hesitant to weigh in. “If you’re too scared to talk about the crisis that is this president, then you’re too scared to BE president,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TomSteyer/status/1093646417044754437\">he tweeted</a> Thursday night. So Steyer is putting away the carrot and taking out the stick.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Steyer announced that he is launching a new political action committee to turn up the heat on key Democrats by going behind their backs and into their districts with a pro-impeachment TV and advertising blitz. According to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/07/trump-impeachment-tom-steyer-house-democrats-1157592\">Politico</a>, Steyer’s top targets include three of the most powerful Democrats in the House: Oversight Chairman <strong>Elijah Cumming,</strong> Judiciary Chairman <strong>Jerry Nadler,</strong> and Ways and Means Chairman <strong>Richard Neal.</strong> Other potential targets include Majority Whip <strong>Jim Clyburn,</strong> Majority Leader <strong>Steny Hoyer,</strong> and even Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi.</strong> <strong>Kevin Mack,</strong> Steyer’s lead strategist, told Politico that the goal isn’t to put money behind primary challengers&#8212;at least not yet. But the group has virtually unlimited money to spend on staff, ads, and volunteers. “Why does Steny Hoyer get a pass, why does Jim Clyburn get a pass?” Mack said. “They’re all hiding behind the Mueller report.”</p>\n<p>The Need to Impeach PAC, which currently has a $40 million war chest, will hold its <a href=\"https://www.masslive.com/politics/2019/02/need-to-impeach-to-hold-springfield-town-hall-call-on-us-rep-richard-neal-to-support-impeachment.html\">first event</a> in Springfield, Massachusetts&#8212;an “Impeachment Town Hall” with the express purpose of encouraging the residents of Springfield to demand that Representative Neal start looking into impeachment by subpoenaing the president’s tax returns. They will also spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on ads to run in Neal’s district, with messages like “It’s time to hold Donald Trump accountable, and we can do our part here in Massachusetts. All we need is our Congressman Richard Neal to be with us.” (Neal is <a href=\"https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/02/04/tv-ads-call-on-us-rep-neal-to-subpoena-trump-tax-returns/\">reportedly</a> consulting legal experts on how to take the “unprecedented” step of subpoenaing the tax returns.)</p>\n<p>The power play might be construed as an attempt to take politicians hostage&#8212;<em>do as I say, and I won’t remove you from office.</em> But Steyer sees it differently. “There’s a gigantic cost to not listening to your constituents,” he explained to Politico. “There’s a gigantic cost to thumbing your nose at democracy.”</p>\n<p>Pelosi, for her part, pointed out the irony of saying that Steyer was a representative of <em>their</em> constituents: “Wait a minute, let me get this straight; a billionaire from California is coming into the district to spend money against Richie [Richard Neal], who used to be the mayor of Springfield, and is now the chairman of the Ways and Means committee who is making us very proud of Massachusetts,” she said, calling Steyer’s effort “a waste of time and money.”</p>\n<p>Pelosi, a veteran legislator, has repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/04/politics/nancy-pelosi-control-democrats-impeachment-urge/index.html\">stated on the record</a> that she is holding off on a push for impeachment, arguing that the political risk is too high. Even if Pelosi and the House pass articles of impeachment against Trump, the Senate, still controlled by Republicans under the direction of <strong>Mitch McConnell,</strong> is unlikely to convict and remove him.</p>\n<p>Steyer doesn’t buy that argument. “We’re not saying, ‘We’re so brilliant, listen to us,’ we’re saying, ‘Listen to your constituents,’” Steyer said. “It’s not like we can just hold our breath until something happens.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a

<em>Murder on the Orient Express,</em> has died. He was 82 years old.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://apnews.com/d72299a7c1794831baed7ff55f092e5b?\">a statement</a> on Friday, his family said the actor “passed away peacefully after a short illness with those closest to him by his side.”</p>\n<p>Finney, born in Lancashire, was a formally trained actor who studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, a classic stomping ground that counts actors like <strong>Kenneth Branagh</strong> and <strong>Anthony Hopkins</strong> among its notable alumni. But Finney didn’t have great aspirations upon enrollment. “There was no burning ambition to be an actor,” he told <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/this-might-possibly-be-albert-finney-107130/\"><em>Rolling Stone</em></a> in 1982 of his decision to pursue drama. “I thought, this is fine, I enjoy it. And there was no sense of going to get away; I was not shaking the provincial dust off my feet, because I didn’t suspect there was any.”</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the young actor’s talent was instantly apparent. He quickly delved into film, making his debut in the 1960 Laurence Olivier drama <em>The Entertainer.</em> Stardom came soon after when Finney took the titular role in <em>Tom Jones,</em> the unconventional 1963 comedy about a lively young man in 18th-century England. The film earned Finney the first of five Oscar nominations; his last one arrived in 2001, for best supporting actor in <em>Erin Brockovich.</em> (Finney never ended up winning a statuette, though.) Where most actors would immediately move on to a new project after earning acclaim with a film like <em>Tom Jones,</em> Finney took the entire year off, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/04/movies/for-albert-finney-risk-is-everything.html\">declining roles</a> so he could instead go sail on the Pacific.</p>\n<p>Finney also starred in a slew of other memorable films, including <em>Murder on the Orient Express</em> (1974), playing Hercule Poirot, and <em>Big Fish.</em> He also lent his presence to big-budget actions films, including the 2012 James Bond movie <em>Skyfall</em> and <em>The Bourne Ultimatum.</em> Finney crisscrossed between theater and television as well, earning a Laurence Olivier Award, two Tony nominations, and an Emmy (for his portrayal of Winston Churchill in the 2002 TV movie <em>The Gathering Storm</em>). For all his acclaim, he was once offered the honorary title of CBE; he <a href=\"https://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/10035F4843A2700C?p=UKNB\">turned it down</a>, because he felt it “perpetuates snobbery.”</p>\n<p>The actor married three times over the course of his life, first to actress Jane Wenham (with whom he had a son, <strong>Simon</strong>), then French film star <strong>Anouk Aimée,</strong> and then Pene Delmage.</p>\n<p>In a 1983 interview with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/04/movies/for-albert-finney-risk-is-everything.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, Finney once mused about the difficulties of working in theater. “All the effort, all the struggle and sacrifice of an actor and everyone in a theater company goes into creating a momentary illusion. It is like a dream, and when it’s over, it’s over. Gone.” However, he added, “what a lot of people spend their lives doing may not add up to a hill of beans. But their love, effort, and devotion goes into doing it, and it becomes worthwhile.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The <a

href=\"https://www.axios.com/2020-presidential-election-nikki-haley-89987260-8dae-4a78-8679-09ad56bd872a.html\">news</a> that <strong>Nikki Haley,</strong> the former ambassador to the United Nations, would be the guest of honor at a donor dinner organized by G.O.P. mega-donor <strong>Paul Singer</strong> later this month, set off a familiar wave of speculation. Would Haley, a shining star in the Republican Party, run against <strong>Donald Trump</strong> in 2020? “Alarm bells going off in Trump world,” <strong>Bill Kristol,</strong> a conservative commentator and the founder of the now defunct <em>Weekly Standard</em> magazine, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/1094623089541955584\">wrote on Twitter</a>, suggesting that the former South Carolina governor could be “a possible replacement for Trump in 2020.”</p>\n<p>Kristol, of course, is the ur-Never-Trumper, and this was wishful thinking. Haley allies and G.O.P. strategists were quick to dismiss the speculation that the former ambassador would primary her former boss. “Guys like Bill Kristol are about as reliable as a broken Magic 8 Ball these days when it comes to politics,” <strong>Rob Godfrey,</strong> Haley’s former deputy chief of staff and chief spokesperson, told me Monday.</p>\n<p>Certainly, under almost all circumstances, it would be foolish for Haley to challenge Trump. The president currently enjoys an <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx\">88 percent approval rating</a> among Republicans&#8212;all but guaranteeing that he will be the G.O.P. nominee, unless he leaves office or decides not to run. If she were to launch a primary bid, Haley would also squander all the good will with the president’s MAGA base she’s worked so hard to build up in her two-year tenure in Turtle Bay. “There is no environment in which she is going to run against Trump. That is her ticket,” one G.O.P. operative told me. “That would be like <strong>Tom Brady</strong> trying to push out <strong>Bill Belichick</strong> . . . That would never happen.”</p>\n<p>Haley herself has been unequivocal in her support of Trump in 2020. But that doesn’t mean she’s not laying the groundwork for an Oval Office bid. It is hard to identify a Republican politician with greater star power than Haley. Her <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/30/ex-un-ambassador-nikki-haley-charging-200000-per-speaking-gig.html\">reported</a> $200,000 price tag for speaking events would suggest a high demand for the ambassador. Even among Democrats, she boasts a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/nikki-haley-most-popular-trump-administration-f3698066-76e3-462f-92cd-472e3c58ca7a.html\">55 percent approval rating</a>. And by the standards set after <strong>Mitt Romney’s</strong> 2012 defeat, in a pre-Trump world, Haley&#8212;a daughter of immigrants; tough on bigotry with all the right politics&#8212;could be a vessel for a new Republican Party. “Nikki Haley is one of the brightest stars that the Republican Party has and is somebody who has universal approval within the party,” <strong>Doug Heye,</strong> a former communications director for the Republican National Committee, told me. “Any talk in the 2020 context is making too much of this. What she does after that? I think it is up to her and she can go very, very far.”</p>\n<p>Singer, a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/us/politics/trump-dossier-paul-singer.html\">fervent anti-Trumper in 2016</a>, is a useful, deep-pocketed friend to have in her corner. And a Haley-Singer alliance would certainly be symbiotic. During the 2016 election, the billionaire hedge-fund manager <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/12/18/billionaire-paul-singer-emerges-as-key-financial-ally-for-rubio-campaign-and-super-pac/\">threw millions behind</a> Haley’s No. 1 draft pick in the Republican primary, Senator <strong>Marco Rubio.</strong> Notably, <strong>Jon Lerner,</strong> a Republican pollster who managed Haley’s successful gubernatorial bid and served as one of her top aides at the United Nations, ran the pro-Rubio Conservative Solutions PAC during the 2016 cycle. “Obviously, this is the first event of the Ambassador’s 2024 presidential campaign,” <strong>Terry Sullivan,</strong> who worked as Rubio’s campaign manager, said of the Singer event.</p>\n<p>Nearly half a dozen G.O.P. sources agreed that Haley is well-positioned for the next election cycle. “She’s almost certain to run for president in 2024, probably against Vice President <strong>[Mike] Pence,</strong> Governor <strong>[Greg] Abbott,</strong> and a slew of U.S. senators. It will be a feeding frenzy, not unlike the Democratic brawl we face currently,” said <strong>George Seay,</strong> a prominent Texas-based G.O.P. donor who also initially backed Rubio in the last presidential cycle. Of course, he cautioned, “This is many years out.”</p>\n<p>While history would suggest that Pence would be first in the line of succession, there is a sense among some Republicans that his lapdog act has cost him, and the telegenic and compelling Haley would easily eclipse him in a crowded field. “Nobody thinks that Mike Pence has availed himself very well to take the next step,” the G.O.P. operative told me. “He might be [a 2024 candidate], but nobody respects his political juice because he looks like one of those service puppies that you take on an airplane.”</p>\n<p>Of course, there is a non-zero chance that Trump won’t be leading the Republican ticket in 2020. As <strong>Robert Mueller</strong> and his team of prosecutors tunnel out of the spotlight and newly empowered House Democrats probe everything from the president’s foreign ties to his son-in-law’s security clearance, Trump faces an unprecedented level of scrutiny in his second two years in office&#8212;and no one knows where it might end. As Sullivan put it, “Anything is possible on the Trump Show.”</p>\n<p><em>This article has been updated.</em></p>","rubric":"2020","socialTitle":"“Anything Is Possible”: GOP Insiders See Haley in the White House ","socialDescription":"A primary challenge is likely out of the question.

After months of campaigning, the 2018-2019 awards season has come to an end, culminating in a hostless Oscars that was, all things considered, pretty smooth sailing until <em>Green Book</em>&#8212;the season’s most divisive film&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/what-green-books-best-picture-oscar-does-and-does-not-mean\">won best picture</a>. But it’s over! That’s that! Another season has come and gone, leaving industry figures free to forget about the Oscars. Except, of course, for one small problem: in the industry, no one is ever not thinking about the Oscars. And now that the 2019 ceremony is over, we may as well look ahead&#8212;way ahead!&#8212;to the 2020 ceremony and take a stab at guessing which films will be up for gold next year.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with the films that made an impact at Sundance (a more comprehensive take on which <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/sundance-2019-oscars-2020\">can be found here</a>). Take <em>The Report,</em> a political thriller about an investigation into C.I.A. torture methods, starring perennial Oscar nominee <strong>Annette Bening</strong> as <strong>Dianne Feinstein</strong> as well as <strong>Adam Driver.</strong> This film, confidently picked up by Amazon for some $14 million, has Oscar buzz written all over it, thanks to its ensemble (Bening has “It’s Her Time” syndrome, although we all saw how well that wound up working out for <strong>Glenn Close</strong>) and writer-director <strong>Scott Z. Burns.</strong></p>\n<p>The streamer also spent quite a bit on two other critical hits with crowd-pleasing potential. The first is <em>Late Night,</em> the <strong>Mindy Kaling</strong> dramedy that seems poised to at least get a best-original-screenplay nod if everything falls into place, while star <strong>Emma Thompson,</strong> a two-time Oscar winner, could maybe eke out a nod for herself. The second is <em>Brittany Runs a Marathon,</em> a <strong>Jillian Bell</strong>-starring dramedy about a flailing millennial that could also have screenplay potential. (If <em>The Big Sick</em> could do it, why not <em>Brittany</em>?)</p>\n<p>Outside of Amazon picks, there’s also <em>Clemency,</em> the Grand Jury-winning drama directed by <strong>Chinonye Chukwu</strong> and starring <strong>Alfre Woodard</strong>&#8212;who, like Bening, is in the “Long Overdue for an Oscar” camp. But <em>Clemency</em> has yet to be picked up by a distributor, so it’s unclear if the film will ever get big campaigning power behind it, let alone a day in theaters.</p>\n<p>While we’re looking at Sundance, let’s also appraise two projects picked up there by best-picture-winning distributor A24: <em>The Souvenir</em> and <em>The Farewell.</em> The former film stars <strong>Tilda Swinton</strong> and her real-life daughter, <strong>Honor Swinton-Byrne,</strong> and revolves around a complicated love story&#8212;critics <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_souvenir\">ate it up</a>. There’s room for acting accolades for both of the ladies Swinton (imagine the delightful way these two would navigate the throes of awards campaigning!) and co-star <strong>Tom Burke,</strong> as well as potential nominations for writer-director <strong>Joanna Hogg.</strong></p>\n<p><em>The Farewell</em> has similar appeal, starring current golden girl <strong>Awkwafina</strong> as a young woman who finds out her grandmother only has a short time to live. Written and directed by <strong>Lulu Wang,</strong> the well-reviewed film could give the actress her first big awards push, after having a breakout year in films like <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> and <em>Ocean’s 8.</em> Should things go <em>really</em> well for these two films, perhaps <em>The Farewell</em> and <em>The Souvenir</em> could even fight their way into the best-picture race, avenging snubbed A24 films like <em>The Florida Project</em> and <em>Eighth Grade.</em></p>\n<p>Now, on to a few films that cater directly to Academy voters and will be sure to have muscular campaigns behind them. There’s no better place to start than <em>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,</em> the Fred Rogers movie starring <strong>Tom Hanks</strong> as the beloved children’s programming host. Directed by <strong>Marielle Heller</strong>&#8212;snubbed this year for the finely wrought <em>Can You Ever Forgive Me?</em>&#8212;this film has easy potential to land a best-actor nod, as well as best director for Heller. (Granted, this is all pure speculation, as the film is not even complete yet.) Same goes for <strong>Greta Gerwig’s</strong> upcoming remake of <em>Little Women,</em> which on its face seems like a prime candidate for best director, best adapted screenplay, best costume design, and best actress (for <strong>Saoirse Ronan</strong>&#8212;who, with three Oscar noms under her belt, is gunning for <strong>Kate Winslet’s</strong> old record for the youngest actress with the most nods). Gerwig’s <em>Lady Bird</em> famously walked away empty-handed at the 2018 Oscars (a true injustice!), so this literary rebound feels like a surefooted choice to get the Academy’s attention.</p>\n<p>Another film ready-made for the Academy? <strong>Jay Roach’s</strong> upcoming drama about Roger Ailes’s toxic fall from grace. The stacked cast includes <strong>Charlize Theron</strong> as <strong>Megyn Kelly,</strong> <strong>Nicole Kidman</strong> as <strong>Gretchen Carlson,</strong> and <strong>Margot Robbie</strong> as the fictional Kayla Pospisil, rounded out by <strong>Allison Janney</strong> as <strong>Susan Estrich</strong> and <strong>Connie Britton</strong> as <strong>Beth Ailes.</strong> <strong>John Lithgow</strong> stars as Ailes. Bad luck with this bunch of nobodies, hm? Though the similar-seeming <em>Vice</em> walked away from the Oscars with just a single award&#8212;for hair and makeup&#8212;any of these stars seem to be a safe pick if you’re trying to suss out who will be <em>the</em> acting contender of the bunch. Kidman and Theron, with their showy roles and past Oscar wins, are the most obvious choices, but you also can’t rule out the power of <em>I, Tonya</em> duo Janney and Robbie, the latter of whom is one of the savviest actors working today.</p>\n<p>Also in that realm: this year’s <strong>Elton John</strong> biopic, <em>Rocketman.</em> Starring <strong>Taron Egerton</strong> as the legendary singer, the film might pick up where <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em> left off, cashing in on the Academy’s utter devotion to vintage rock. Egerton has already <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/taron-egerton-elton-john-duet-video-tiny-dancer-rocketman-oscars\">(unofficially) kicked off</a> his best-actor Oscar campaign, so get ready to see him stumping <em>hard</em> this year.</p>\n<p>In the auteur space, <strong>Quentin Tarantino</strong> and <strong>Martin Scorsese</strong> could battle for best-director nods thanks to <em>Once Upon a Time . . . in Hollywood</em> and <em>The Irishman,</em> respectively. The former stars <strong>Leonardo DiCaprio,</strong> <strong>Brad Pitt</strong> (also in another potential best-picture contender, the spacey <em>Ad Astra,</em> this year), and Robbie; the latter stars <strong>Robert De Niro,</strong> <strong>Al Pacino,</strong> <strong>Joe Pesci,</strong> and <strong>Harvey Keitel.</strong> If at least one of these films doesn’t end up with a handful of nominations&#8212;including actor, director, and best-picture nods&#8212;we’ll be very surprised. While we’re at it, let’s throw two-time Oscar winner <strong>Ang Lee</strong> into the mix, whose next film, <em>Gemini Man,</em> starring <strong>Will Smith,</strong> doesn’t seem like a natural lock because of its sci-fi bent. But it could certainly find itself in the technical categories, fighting for space with Disney films like <em>Star Wars: Episode IX</em> and the <em>Lion King</em> remake&#8212;which will probably see a not-insubstantial amount of its campaign revolve around whichever original song <strong>Beyoncé</strong> releases for the soundtrack. If we’re lucky, maybe she’ll perform it at the Oscars themselves next year, too.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; What 2019’s Oscar nominees <a

The one the Trump administration essentially let Saudi Arabia get away with? For those who need a quick refresher: on October 2, <em>The Washington Post</em> columnist entered the Saudi consulate in Turkey and was never seen again. After initially denying it had any knowledge of the matter, the Kingdom <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jamal-khashoggi-killing-a-timeline-of-the-saudis-shifting-story-2018-10#the-whereabouts-of-khashoggis-body-are-unknown-18\">admitted</a> Khashoggi had died inside the consulate, first claiming it happened in a fistfight, and later saying his killing was, in fact, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-45979507\">pre-meditated</a>. All of this, plus the conclusion by the C.I.A. that Crown Prince <strong>Mohammed bin Salman</strong> had <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html\">ordered the assassination</a> of a U.S. resident, should have resulted in the president of the United States punishing, or at the very least condemning, the de facto leader but of course <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/02/13/trump-shields-saudi-crown-prince/?utm_term=.13bad6df1f92\">he did nothing of the sort</a>. Anyway, Trump’s good buddy <strong>Tom Barrack</strong> was asked about the whole thing at a Milken Institute summit in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday, and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-13/colony-s-barrack-says-criticism-of-khashoggi-murder-a-mistake\">here’s what he had to say</a>:</p>\n<p>“Whatever happened in Saudi Arabia, the atrocities in America are equal or worse to the atrocities in Saudi Arabia. . . . The atrocities in any autocratic country are dictated by the rule of law. So for us to dictate what we think is the moral code there when we have a young man and a regime that’s trying to push themselves into 2030 I think is a mistake.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/cfc76f84-a44f-4420-b825-6b55c781fab4?customColor=%23ff0000\"><iframe height=\"250\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/cfc76f84-a44f-4420-b825-6b55c781fab4?customColor=%23ff0000\"></iframe></div></div></div><p><strong><em>iTunes user?

The illegal investments led to about $227,000 in profits, while allowing him to avoid $377,000 of losses, according to the U.S. attorney’s office in Newark, New Jersey, which filed criminal charges against Levoff.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For instance, in July 2015, Levoff learned that Apple wouldn’t meet analysts’ third-quarter forecast for iPhone sales, the S.E.C. said in a related civil complaint. That month, he sold about $10 million of Apple stock&#8212;virtually all of his holdings. When the company reported earnings, its shares plunged more than 4 percent. Levoff avoided losing about $345,000, the S.E.C. said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Kevin Marino,</strong> Levoff’s attorney, told Bloomberg he is reviewing the charges and looks forward to defending his client “with respect to these allegations.”</p>\n<p><strong>Lonely group of millionaires wants higher taxes</strong></p>\n<p>If you ask the super-rich decrying recent tax proposals as the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/davos-billionaires-aoc-tax-proposal\">first in a series of steps</a> that <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/01/29/bloomberg-compares-warren-ultra-millionaire-tax-venezuela/HjIQ22sfeOl4OZyDTNetBN/story.html\">end in the collapse of Western society</a>, these people should be locked in a tower and never heard from again. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/business/rich-people-against-tax-cut.html\">Per <em>The New York Times</em></a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Stephen Prince,</strong> a Democrat from Nashville, is none too pleased about his windfall. He believes the Trump tax cuts are misguided and ultimately bad for the country, even as they pad his already robust bank account. “I’m pissed off about it,” said Mr. Prince, speaking via FaceTime during a four-month, around-the-world cruise with his wife.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Prince has found camaraderie among an ad hoc group of wealthy individuals known as the Patriotic Millionaires. Founded in 2010 by <strong>Morris Pearl,</strong> a former BlackRock executive, the loose-knit group advocates higher taxes on businesses and the wealthy. In recent years, they have met with legislators in Washington and various state capitals, testified before Congress and endorsed candidates who endorse higher taxes on the rich.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“We’re very concerned about this huge inequality thing,” Pearl told the <em>Times.</em> “And the tax cut was designed to make the rich richer. I don’t work at all, but I’m making more money than most people who do work, and I’m paying less taxes than they do. It’s a pretty good deal if you can get it, but it’s not good for the country.”</p>\n<p><strong>Jack Dorsey loves what Elon Musk is doing on Twitter</strong></p>\n<p>Which is: courting defamation lawsuits and getting sued by the S.E.C., <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jack-dorsey-says-elon-musk-is-his-favorite-twitter-user-misses-the-irony-2019-02-12\">among other things</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Twitter Inc. Chief Executive Jack Dorsey raised some eyebrows Tuesday during a chaotic live-tweet interview when he was asked who’s the most exciting and influential person on his platform. . . . While Musk is among the most prolific and newsworthy tweeters in Silicon Valley, that has also been to his detriment. Musk has been accused of bullying journalists on Twitter, and Tesla stock has regularly swung wildly based on Musk’s candid tweets, leading some analysts and investors to suggest he should rein in his tweeting habit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some of his tweets have had serious consequences: Musk is facing a defamation lawsuit for calling a British cave diver a pedophile in a tweet, and he lost his job as chairman of Tesla last year as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission after an ill-fated tweet that suggested Tesla had financial backing to go private&#8212;in fact, it did not, leading to allegations that he misled investors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>U.S. Tax Revenues Fall, Deficit Widens in Wake of New Tax Law (<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-tax-revenue-declined-0-4-in-2018-11550084426?\"><em>W.S.J.</em></a>)</p>\n<p>Bank of America says no going back on its $400m plans for Brexit move (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9d43bba-2f7a-11e9-8744-e7016697f225\"><em>Financial Times</em></a>)</p>\n<p>How a Nasdaq Loophole Fueled One Stock’s Rise of 3,750 Percent (<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-a-nasdaq-loophole-fueled-one-stocks-rise-of-3-750-11550066400\"><em>W.S.J.</em></a>)</p>\n<p><strong>Neri Oxman</strong> Has Pershing Square Capital Up Almost 25 Percent on the Year (<a href=\"https://dealbreaker.com/2019/02/bill-ackman-up-big-on-love\">DealBreaker</a>)</p>\n<p>Royalties on 1983 Finance Classic “Trading Places” Go Up for Bid (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-12/royalties-on-1983-finance-classic-trading-places-go-up-for-bid\">Bloomberg</a>)</p>\n<p>Fed official warns against inadvertently crimping U.S. growth (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91bd0a4c-2fb8-11e9-8744-e7016697f225\"><em>Financial Times</em></a>)</p>\n<p>Zinke teaming up with Lewandowski at D.C. lobbying firm (<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/13/ryan-zinke-lobbying-firm-1168926\">Politico</a>)</p>\n<p>Chuck E.

Movie","promoHed":"Rom-Com Queen Meg Ryan Is Writing a Swoon-Worthy New Movie","dek":"And she might direct it, too.","promoDek":"And she might direct it, too.","body":"<p>You can’t talk about American romantic comedies without talking about <strong>Meg Ryan.</strong> She is synonymous with the genre, having ascended to ultimate rom-com queen status in the 80s and 90s. Since then, there have been plenty of attempts to usurp her throne, but none&#8212;<em>none!</em>&#8212;have managed to overtake her title. Though Ryan has spent the last few years on an acting hiatus, she’s also felt that old familiar call&#8212;and, at long last, is answering it. In an interview with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/15/magazine/meg-ryan-romantic-comedy.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, Ryan revealed that she’s currently writing a new romantic comedy of her own, with plans to possibly direct it as well.</p>\n<p>“It’s at Working Title Films. I’ll just leave it at that,” she said. “Getting the green light, <strong>David [Marchese,</strong> the interviewer]. My God. You feel like you’re jinxing it if you’re talking about it. Hopefully it’s for me to direct.”</p>\n<p>It’s what we deserve! Ryan only recently got in the directing game, helming the feature <em>Ithaca</em> in 2015. The film, decidedly not a rom-com, is a World War II-era drama about a bike telegraph messenger, starring <strong>Alex Neustaedter</strong> as well as Ryan, her son <strong>Jack Quaid,</strong> <strong>Sam Shepard,</strong> and <strong>Tom Hanks</strong> (who flew <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/09/meg-ryan-ithaca-interview\">across the country</a> to drop into the film and reunite with his old rom-com scene partner).</p>\n<p>Frankly, now is a perfect time for Ryan to get back into the rom-com game. Netflix has been churning out lighthearted romances over the last year, reviving and refreshing the genre <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/set-it-up-zoey-deutch-glen-powell-kissing-booth-joey-king-jacob-elordi-netflix\">with films like</a> <em>Set It Up</em> and <em>To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before.</em> The streamer also recently announced plans for sequels to <em>To All the Boys</em> and <em>The Kissing Booth,</em> another rom-com hit.</p>\n<p>In the interview, Ryan said that working on a rom-com of her own has actually changed her view of the genre. “I’m aware now that romantic comedies are confections, but they have construction,” she said. “There’s architecture. It’s not something I was aware of back then.”</p>\n<p>She also got candid, once again, about her departure from acting, which was sparked by her ill-received turn in the 2003 film <em>In the Cut.</em> “I think the feeling with Hollywood was mutual,” she said. “I felt done when they felt done, probably.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The <a

This time, the outcry wasn’t just from the right: Democratic leadership issued a swift and stinging rebuke, condemning Omar’s use of “anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel’s supporters” as “deeply offensive.” On Monday afternoon, Omar issued a statement in which she “unequivocally” apologized, even as she reaffirmed the “problematic role of lobbyists in our politics.”</p>\n<p>Largely satisfied with Omar’s mea culpa, Democrats want to forgive and forget. “It was a mistake. She apologized,” explained the Democratic aide. “Some people were more satisfied with her apology than others. But we can’t waste days and weeks on this, because this is totally going to distract us from our agenda if we get hung up on this infighting.” The tweet about AIPAC, this person said, was “obviously a big self-inflicted wound, but we are not going to now look at the Republicans moving the goalposts and be responsive to them.”</p>\n<p>Republicans, however, aren’t ready to move on. Aboard Air Force One on Monday evening, Trump told reporters that Omar should “be ashamed of herself.” In the White House the following day, the president upped the ante. “It’s terrible what she said, and I think she should either resign from Congress, or she should certainly resign from the House Foreign Affairs Committee,” Trump said. On Wednesday, Vice President <strong>Mike Pence</strong> followed his boss’s lead and called on Omar to resign. “At minimum,” he said, “Democratic leaders should remove her from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.”</p>\n<p>House Democratic leaders are not entertaining either idea. “Ridiculous,” a spokesperson for <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> told me Tuesday night. But after Trump helped paint the G.O.P. as the party of bigotry, Republicans seem eager to take a scalp of their own&#8212;and drive a wedge through the Democratic ranks by turning some of the party’s new rising stars into potent symbols of left-wing radicalism. “Crazy to watch what House Dems are empowering/elevating,” Congressman <strong>Lee Zeldin,</strong> who also sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/repleezeldin/status/1090390872867463177\">wrote</a> on Twitter last month, taking aim at Omar. They have also targeted Michigan Congresswoman <strong>Rashida Tlaib,</strong> a Palestinian-American, who is also critical of Israel and, like Omar, supports the Palestinian-led B.D.S. movement, which Republicans have characterized as anti-Semitic. Minority Leader <strong>Kevin McCarthy,</strong> <strong>Paul Ryan’s</strong> successor, has called on Pelosi to “take action” against Tlaib and Omar, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/mccarthy-gop-challenge-house-democrats-to-denounce-alleged-anti-semitism/2019/02/08/aef28514-2bae-11e9-b2fc-721718903bfc_story.html?utm_term=.1122797af106\">equating</a> their policy views on Israel to Steve King’s support for white supremacy.</p>\n<p>“McCarthy and Lee Zeldin have been trying to stir the pot for a couple of weeks,” the Democratic aide told me. “We haven’t really taken the bait.” Party insiders are particularly irritated given Trump’s own long history of trafficking in anti-Semitic tropes. While speaking at a forum hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition in December 2015, Trump said, “You’re not going to support me because I don’t want your money . . . You want to control your own politician.” In 2016, at the height of the presidential campaign, Trump&#8212;whose daughter, <strong>Ivanka,</strong> and grandchildren are Jewish&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/us/politics/trump-clinton-star-of-david.html\">tweeted</a> an illustration of <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> surrounded by hundred-dollar bills and a Star of David shape with the words “most corrupt candidate ever!” McCarthy’s hands aren’t clean either: in a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/28/politics/tom-steyer-mccarthy-tweet/index.html\">since-deleted tweet</a> from last October, the California congressman suggested that three Jewish billionaires&#8212;<strong>George Soros,</strong> <strong>Tom Steyer,</strong> and <strong>Michael Bloomberg</strong>&#8212;were trying to “buy” the midterm elections.</p>\n<p>“That is the exact same anti-Semitic trope that members denounced Congresswoman Omar for, and Kevin McCarthy has the nerve to say that trafficking in anti-Semitic tropes is all of a sudden unacceptable,” the Democratic aide said. “This is what their party has become. It is has become a den of conspiracy theorists and bigots and anti-Semites, or at least a place where anti-Semitic notions are not condemned and are given fertile ground.” Omar’s tweet crossed a line, Democrats say, but at least she apologized.</p>\n<p>Whether Republicans can accept that apology, too, remains to be seen. As partisanship deepens, both Republicans and Democrats are increasingly responding to racial and sexual issues in their own caucus by invoking the misdeeds of their colleagues across the aisle rather adjudicating them individually, on a moral level. It’s not clarifying to compare Ilhan’s comments to Trump’s “both sides” equivocation, just as it’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/what-democrats-can-learn-from-their-virginia-racism-mess\">unfair</a> to compare <strong>Ralph Northam</strong> and <strong>Justin Fairfax.</strong> What’s lost in it all, however, is that in our fast-twitch world we can no longer judge these instances are their own. Instead, they are considered as misdeeds along a sliding scale or spectrum, with varying political consequences.</p>\n<p>Omar, for one, says she wants to do better. Can Republicans take her at her word?</p>\n<p>“No one is perfect, but what we’ve seen is that many in the right wing have zeroed in on Reps. Omar and Tlaib, as they’ve done women of color across the board, in an attempt to silence them and delegitimize their thoughts and stances,” <strong>Denzel McCampbell,</strong> Tlaib’s communications director, told me. “Both Reps. Omar and Tlaib have shown a great willingness to listen to their critics and grow from these experiences, because they are genuinely committed to mutual respect and understanding, something that other members must be willing to do as well&#8212;and something we have yet to see from many.”</p>\n<p>Even so, Omar is on thin ice with her colleagues. “We hope that Representative Omar will learn from this moment,” the senior staffer told me. “Her position is not consistent with the rest of the Democrats on the committee.”</p>","rubric":"Democrats","socialTitle":"“Beyond Parody”: Democrats Grapple

(“Rosebud . . .” comes to mind.) And while many of the last quarter-century’s films have awed, inspired, and offered up iconic entries into the cultural canon, only some&#8212;and particularly, only a few individual moments&#8212;have genuinely influenced how future films were made. So, what makes that list? To mark the 25th edition of the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/hollywood-cover-2019?verso=true\">Hollywood Issue</a>, <em>Vanity Fair</em>’s film critics pinpointed 25 film scenes since 1995 that changed the industry, the art form, and even the culture, and our reporters spoke to the performers and filmmakers who made them happen.</p>\n<p>A brief note from the editors on magazine math: <em>Vanity Fair</em> has published 25 Hollywood Issues beginning in 1995. In the spirit of our anniversary, we have taken that as our start date. Those decrying a lack of <em>Pulp Fiction</em> et al. on this list <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/preview-quentin-tarantino-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood\">can get their Tarantino dose elsewhere</a> in this year’s edition.</p>\n<h2><em>TOY STORY,</em> 1995</h2>\n<h3>Playtime</h3>\n<p>It’s all been there from the very beginning: the consummate genre cleverness, the animation with its affectedly rounded edges and warm tones, and the emotional appeals to not only kids but their nostalgic parents, who wish they were kids. All of this&#8212;what would come to be identified as the Pixar trademark&#8212;springs to life, fully formed, in the opening moments of the company’s 1995 debut film, <em>Toy Story,</em> as a boy named Andy plays cowboys with his delightfully mismatched toys: a cowpoke named Woody, Mr. Potato Head, and the rest.</p>\n<p>So began the transformation of mainstream American animation, which, on the shoulders of Pixar, shifted dramatically toward computers and the rich, clever storytelling that has become as synonymous with Pixar as photocopies are to Xerox. It’s fascinating to watch this opening scene now, knowing what Pixar would become. Everything here&#8212;the Randy Newman needle drop, the adolescent delight&#8212;was a choice that would come to define a generation (and then some) of children and parents worldwide. <em>&#8212;K. Austin Collins</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Pete Docter, animator/co-writer</strong></p>\n<p>“We had no idea what was going on. We didn’t know how many people to hire, how long it would take, but we dove in and blindly went forward. That’s the way to go, damn the torpedoes. In that sense, I look back at it fondly. From my standpoint, I was one of the grunts, I was not leading the charge. That was John Lasseter and Ralph Guggenheim who had to field all the trouble. For me it felt like an extension of school, a bunch of guys doing a fun project in their garage. It felt like something I would do even if they didn’t pay me. Like most things, you didn’t know at the time it was something to really value and pay attention to. My wife and I had just gotten married. I would work all day, come home and have dinner, and then she would come back to work with me and play video games while I animated late into the night.” <em>&#8212;As told to Katey Rich</em></p>\n<h2><em>SCREAM,</em> 1996</h2>\n<h3>The Cold Open</h3>\n<p>As the formidable teen boom of the late 1990s and early aughts was first churning into motion, along came director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson’s zippy classic, all at once reverent and iconoclastic toward the slasher genre. No scene in the film was more indelible than Drew Barrymore&#8212;recently having reclaimed star status after some years in the wild&#8212;tangling with Ghostface the killer in the film’s shocking opening minutes. What that scene kicked off was a major cultural evolution, with teens being marketed to more and more as a disposable income-wielding consumer force, and a meta self-awareness seeping its way into every facet of filmed entertainment. The sly, scary wink of <em>Scream</em>’s actually pretty brutal cold open takes its fun seriously&#8212;and taught an entire generation how to talk about what they love. <em>&#8212;Richard Lawson</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Drew Barrymore, “Casey Becker”</strong></p>\n<p>“The script was so well written and the horror genre was sort of lost at that time. I remember everything like it was yesterday. Night after night of shoots at this house crying and hyperventilating. I loved that we turned things on its head a bit. I was originally supposed to play the Neve Campbell role and then I had this epiphany that if I played Casey and got killed in the first scene, all bets were off. Kevin’s writing had this tongue-in-cheek quality to it that felt different and fresh&#8212;a new approach to horror. I think when you do something that gets parodied not once but dozens of times, you definitely get the feeling it had an effect on people.” <em>&#8212;As told to Joanna Robinson</em></p>\n<h2><em>TITANIC,</em> 1997</h2>\n<h3>“I’m King of the World!”</h3>\n<p>It’s not so much that a bunch of movies after James Cameron’s seismic epic tried to copy its mix of sentiment and special effects&#8212;<em>Pearl Harbor</em> certainly did, but is that it? It’s more that <em>Titanic</em> opened the door for more maximalist thinking in Hollywood than had existed for a long time. Cameron pioneered the $200 million budget, and the extensive use of computer graphics in a film with no robots or trips to outer space. He made a true movie star for the ages in Leonardo DiCaprio, no more winningly or brazenly than with the triumphant launch of <em>Titanic</em>’s voyage. As the camera glides lovingly, freely around Cameron’s magnificent creation, he whips up a cinematic awe that’s so palpable it changed a medium’s conception of spectacle in an instant. Little that came in the years after quite matched that dizzy coronation, but a lot of people spent a lot of money trying. <em>&#8212;Richard Lawson</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Danny Nucci, “Fabrizio”</strong></p>\n<p>“When we shot this scene, it was cold and windy and awful down in Rosarito Beach. For the majority of it, we were outside. For the ‘King of the World’ scene, there was a separate piece of set&#8212;a tall tower-piece that just had the front of the ship. Leo and I would go on a construction lift and it would drop us off at the top, and then the lift would go away so that it wasn’t seen during filming. We were trapped on this little tower with our set coats so that we wouldn’t freeze. We were up there for hours because you would have to bring the lift back in, take it up, and then have us go down. So we were basically trapped up there.</p>\n<p>“It was one of the most hysterical experiences. All I remember is we were very hungry. And at some point we both had to pee terribly and there&#39;s no like, ‘Yeah, can we get the lift back in so that we can go to the restroom?’ There was none of that. We’re sitting there cold and hungry, and miserable, and having to pee. And on ‘action,’ it was supposed to be the most joyous experience in the world.” <em>&#8212;As told to Laura Bradley</em></p>\n<h2><em>THE BIG LEBOWSKI,</em> 1998</h2>\n<h3>Gutterballs</h3>\n<p>Since at least the New Hollywood era, our favorite American auteurs have been filling their movies with references to other classic Hollywood movies. They’ve been showing off just how much the history of Hollywood fills their DNA; directors, their public image says, are movie-lovers above all else. And yet even by those standards, it’s funny to see a modern, American cult-film nod, not to Howard Hawks or old gangster movies or the like, but to the dizzying, kaleidoscopic dance numbers of Busby Berkeley, known for filling the screen with circles and rows of showgirls, dancing out geometric fantasies to the audience’s delight.</p>\n<p><em>The Big Lebowski</em> is one such movie, and its famous “Gutterballs” fantasy sequence, with its dancing bowler girls, flying Jeff Bridges, and Viking Julianne Moore, is one such scene. Lebowski is a simmeringly smart&#8212;but also wild&#8212;tale, anchored by a loose, meandering central turn by Jeff Bridges as the Dude, who finds himself caught up in a world of mistaken identity, nihilist thugs, bowling, extortion, and outrageous violence. Not that the plot is what matters. <em>The Big Lebowski</em> is about a world, a political landscape, in which conflicting American values clash against each other, all of it embedded in style, references, and stoner dreaminess. It’s the ultimate American movie, a feature with underground cultural credibility that is also an icon of independent moviemaking and bro-cinephile obsession. <em>&#8212;K. Austin Collins</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Jeff Bridges, “The Dude”</strong></p>\n<p>“I had a little concern about how it was going to be directed by two people. I love my brother, but I think it would be really challenging to direct a film with him. I was wondering how it was gonna be to be directed by these brothers, and the only time that there was any disagreement between them was in that scene. It was just about when I was gonna hit my head with those bowling pins, and Joel said, ‘Now, when you’re gonna hit the bowling pins, kind of wince a little bit, ’cause you’re gonna be expecting some kind of pain.’ And Ethan says, ‘No, really&#8212;you think so? I think he should be kind of smiling, like this is kind of fun to be a bowling ball.’ Joel said, ‘You really think so?’ And it kind of went back and forth like that then finally they just said, ‘Well, let’s shoot it both ways.’ That was the big disagreement.” <em>&#8212;As told to Mike Hogan</em></p>\n<h2><em>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN,</em> 1998</h2>\n<h3>The Storming Of Omaha Beach</h3>\n<p>The inventor of the modern blockbuster had already proven himself a Serious Director with <em>The Color Purple</em> and <em>Schindler’s List,</em> the latter redefining Spielberg’s aesthetic range in startling fashion. But with the opening salvo of his 1998 war masterpiece, Spielberg not only pushed his own art forward&#8212;he changed an entire genre. No films about combat made since would look the way they do without the de-saturated, handheld, blood-splatters-and-all horror of cinema that is this extended sequence: Spielberg and his trusty cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, following a terrible march up a beach, bullets and mortars raining down, sand exploding into carnage. It’s a terrifying scene, either honorable or exploitative in its all vérité, depending on whom you ask. Regardless of any moral assessment, it’s easily one of the most aped and referenced scenes of the late 20th century, inspiring countless other action and war movies, and video games. <em>&#8212;Richard Lawson</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Tom Hanks, “Captain Miller”</strong></p>\n<p>“In our very first talk about the movie, Steven laid out how modern cinema technology made the movie possible in the first place&#8212;especially for the Omaha Beach sequence.  He said no combat movie would have ever been like it. I knew immediately that our job as actors would be to behave and react in the actual physical moment, that we would be trained accordingly over time, and that anything that happened on-screen would be as it should. My rank as captain mattered in training. I had some responsibility and some luxury (my own tent!)&#8212;but on the set, the script played itself out. We all had our moments in the movie and rooted for each other. When I first saw the completed sequence, I wept. The landing, from the boats to the top of the bluff, was just too horrible to watch without becoming undone. People see that landing sequence as a seminal 20 minutes, not just in the history of war movies, but in all of cinema.” <em>&#8212;As told to Katey Rich</em></p>\n<h2><em>THE MATRIX,</em> 1999</h2>\n<h3>Dodging Bullets</h3>\n<p>It was hard for us to pinpoint which exact moment in the Wachowskis’ seminal sci-fi actioner changed filmmaking forever. Was it the opening scene, with Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) battling policemen using a wicked floating kick? Was it hacker-hero Neo (Keanu Reeves) sparring with his mentor, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne)? Was it the hallway gun battle? Any of those would have been valid choices, but the sequence in which Neo dodges bullets on the roof, and Trinity does a kicky “dodge this” while slo-mo shooting a bad guy, contains the most representations of <em>The Matrix</em>’s technical and stylistic flair, which directly shaped 21st-century film. The Wachowskis gave so much to the current action-movie vernacular, seen in <em>300</em> and <em>Wonder Woman</em> and countless other projects that have made the awed Keanu in all of us say “Whoa.” <em>&#8212;Richard Lawson</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Keanu Reeves, “Neo”</strong></p>\n<p>“When it came to shooting Neo dodging the bullets, it was on a stage with a green screen and more than 100 cameras. I was on a wire, and it was extraordinary to be the human piece of ‘bullet time’ and do something physically impossible. I threw myself back, did the choreography&#8212;everyone was really excited hearing the camera shutters. Then, of course, in Wachowski fashion, we did it a whole bunch more, looking for super-perfect. Then, we started to see ‘bullet time’ enter the mainstream in commercials, and the Wachowskis became a part of our visual language. You see them moving a camera like that now during football games. There’s nothing like the original, but it’s still always cool.” <em>&#8212;As told to Joanna Robinson</em></p>\n<h2><em>THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT,</em> 1999</h2>\n<h3>Heather’s Monologue</h3>\n<p>All it took was a brief, close-up glimpse of half of actress Heather Donahue’s panicked face&#8212;teary and dripping&#8212;to get America interested in <em>The Blair Witch Project.</em> Arguably the first film largely marketed on the Internet, this tiny indie-horror film-turned-box office smash and cultural bellwether arrived at the end of the last millennium as a harbinger of things to come. The film’s successful experiment in Internet virality hinged on that footage of Donahue, supposedly a real-life filmmaker who’d gone missing in the Maryland woods, being so visceral and credible. A strange and immediate publicity tool, Heather’s close-up and its deft deployment laid the groundwork for many a future Internet campaign, and gave the found-footage horror genre (perhaps perfected by Blumhouse) more prominence than it ever had in, say, the <em>Cannibal Holocaust</em> days. Heather might have gotten her friends (and herself) killed by a witch, but she made a lasting contribution to the rest of the world. <em>&#8212;Richard Lawson</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Daniel Myrick, co-writer/co-director</strong></p>\n<p>“We needed a moment somewhere at the beginning top of the third act, where Heather finally comes to terms with what&#39;s happening&#8212;and also takes some responsibility for what she’s done. We told Heather, ‘This is the deal: you’ve finally hit a wall and you need a sort of confessional now where you realize you may not get out of this, and you need to leave some kind of last will for your parents and your friends, and apologize.” We just laid that kind of emotional groundwork for her and let her improvise. It went on for, I don’t know, almost 15 minutes; we cut it down to just a few&#8212;the best moments.\nOnce we saw the performance, we knew we had it. She ramped up into it, as you would expect&#8212;after she sort of got into the moment and really let it flow, both with her tears and her snot, which was profuse. Those are legit tears.” <em>&#8212;As told to Laura Bradley</em></p>\n<h2><em>AMERICAN PSYCHO,</em> 2000</h2>\n<h3>“Hip to Be Square”</h3>\n<p>There’s just something about Patrick Bateman. Antiheroes are most certainly not a 21st&#8212;or even 20th&#8212;century innovation. And the history of American movies, specifically, has been full of them, from the down-and-dirty gangsters of the 30s (in real life and the movies) to Clint Eastwood’s mysterious outlier, <em>The Man with No Name,</em> whose silence had the strange effect of tearing Western myths apart.</p>\n<p>And yet neither of those archetypes comes anywhere near to explaining the Bret Easton Ellis invention Bateman, who, as chaotically brought to life by Christian Bale in Mary Harron’s darkly satirical <em>American Psycho,</em> isn’t just an antihero&#8212;because he’s a rich yuppie who terrorizes and brutally murders women and the homeless. He’s an antihero because he’s such a dick about it&#8212;and yet so addictively watchable! No scene better sums up his inexplicably vibrant, outrageous charm than Bateman murdering a colleague while discoursing on the canonical status of the Huey Lewis and the News banger “Hip to Be Square.” And no scene’s popularity is a better testament to our strangely capitalistic affection for bad men&#8212;the kind of cultural error Bateman himself would have railed us for. Arch cultural references became the American pop ethos as of this movie&#8212;to say nothing of Bale, a chameleonic force we would be watching for years. <em>&#8212;K. Austin Collins</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Mary Harron, director</strong></p>\n<p>“I felt the audience could handle this scene being quite comic. Usually, we kept the lighting in the apartment moody&#8212;but when it came to filming this scene, I insisted we have all the lights on bright. I wanted it to be harsh and jarring; I was also thinking Kubrick, <em>A Clockwork Orange.</em> In the very last take, there was one of those lucky accidents that make filming worthwhile: Bateman had just finished killing Paul Allen in a frenzy, and he sits down on the couch and lights a cigar. As he did so, I saw that the blood had only spattered one-half of Christian’s face. In profile, he looked almost normal&#8212;but when you cut to another angle, you saw the bloody side. When it came out, the movie was loved and hated in about equal measure. It was only after a few years that its reputation grew in a way I can’t explain. I think the mixture of black comedy and horror and satire was unfamiliar and uncomfortable, and maybe that very nightmarish portrait of society and Wall Street felt more relevant as time went on.” <em>&#8212;As told to Hillary Busis</em></p>\n<h2><em>CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON,</em> 2000</h2>\n<h3>The Night Fight</h3>\n<p>When <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> reached theaters in 2018, it was hailed as a breakthrough for Asian filmmakers and stars in Hollywood&#8212;really, though, it was the second one, too long delayed toward progress that had been initiated almost two decades before, by Ang Lee’s Oscar-winning worldwide hit, <em>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.</em> The film, produced in China, starring the internationally known Hong Kong action star Chow Yun-fat, and directed by the Taiwanese (and by then widely known in the West) Lee, was an old-fashioned wuxia epic, full of the high-flying martial arts that verge on surrealistic fantasy. <em>Crouching Tiger</em> remains unique for ushering in not only broader Western awareness of this time-honored Hong Kong movie genre, but particularly a mainstream American interest in foreign-language cinema. One that was even bigger than the foreign art-house boom that took American cinemas by storm in the mid-20th century.</p>\n<p>Even in 2018, even given the steeply increased role of Chinese financing in Hollywood, it’s hard to imagine a lush martial-arts melodrama set amid the 19th-century Qing dynasty&#8212;and entirely performed in Mandarin, no less&#8212;becoming a domestic blockbuster. Any one part of that equation would be a nonstarter for the local megaplex. Yet this consummately produced, gorgeous first-act fight explains exactly how <em>Crouching Tiger</em> came to be such a success. Lee’s filmmaking floated and tumbled with the ease of his actors. It’s brought to life in the brief but memorable role for the wuxia great Cheng Pei-pei, who plays the antagonistic star of this scene. Her presence alone is moving, a humbling testament to the merging of East and West that this film would come to embody. <em>&#8212;K. Austin Collins</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Ang Lee, director</strong></p>\n<p>“<em>Crouching Tiger</em> is the opposite [of <em>Brokeback</em>]. I planned everything; everything worked against me. Even the weather. A lot of it was shot in the desert, it was really tough. There’s nothing. At that time, 1999, making that kind of scale of movie in China&#8212;it&#39;s like a handcrafted space shuttle. That’s how it feels. The movie industry was not like today. People are not trained. To start something new, that was ambitious work.</p>\n<p>“<em>Crouching Tiger</em> was meant to be a mainstream Chinese movie, but it hit so big here, even bigger than over there. That was unexpected. Every movie has its fate: sometimes it hits, sometimes you hit the wrong time. I’ve tasted both [laughs]. That one just took off.” <em>&#8212;As told to Yohana Desta</em></p>\n<h2><em>TRAINING DAY,</em> 2001</h2>\n<h3>“King Kong Ain’t Got Shit on Me”</h3>\n<p>With his famous, furious rant as corrupt L.A. police detective Alonzo Harris, Denzel Washington launched a new stage of his career. He won his first Oscar for best actor in a leading role, and began a lucrative partnership with director Antoine Fuqua. The two have gone on to make three more box-office successes together, and Washington asserted himself as quite possibly the last truly bankable movie star in the business (before The Rock came along, at least) with only minimal assists from any franchises. Putting one big moment for one actor on this list may seem like a bit of hyperbole. But Washington’s career&#8212;as both action-thriller hero and awards-worthy thespian&#8212;has been vital to Hollywood’s economy and its understanding of itself over these charged and changing years. Washington was also the first black man to win the best-actor Oscar since Sidney Poitier. That same evening, Halle Berry became the first black woman to win a best-actress Oscar. Those victories marked the hopeful beginnings of the long, tortured process of the Academy&#8212;and the broader industry&#8212;addressing its longstanding and widespread diversity issues. <em>&#8212;Richard Lawson</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Antoine Fuqua, director</strong></p>\n<p>“The King Kong moment came out of Denzel. I remember that moment because we were doing the scene, and he just started going off. I remember looking at the cameraman and saying, ‘I hope you got that, because I don’t think we’re going to get that again.’ Denzel came over to me and goes, ‘Whoo, I don’t know where that came from.’ It was exhausting for him, you saw him just go there in that place. It was one of those moments where it gave you chills. We shot anamorphic lenses, so anamorphic lenses are really sensitive to making sure everything’s in focus. My focus puller came up to me afterwards, his hands were shaking. I started hearing it referenced a lot in rap songs, a lot of rappers saying stuff about Alonzo, or <em>Training Day,</em> or “King Kong ain’t got nothing on me,” or “this is chess, not checkers.” The moment I realized it took on a different life was with Ethan Hawke. Ethan was in Harlem doing something one day and he called me and said, ‘Wow, I’ve got a whole new audience, all these people came up to me.‘ You just set out to make a good movie and somehow it became a cultural thing.” <em>&#8212;As told to Katey Rich</em></p>\n<h2><em>THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS,</em> 2001</h2>\n<h3>Enter Margot</h3>\n<p>Wes Anderson’s films are full of moments that have been mimicked and borrowed from over the last 20 or so years. Maybe the best distillation of that cherished style is Gwyneth Paltrow’s lovely slow-motion walk from a bus, Nico’s melancholy “These Days” playing as Margot Tenenbaum approaches her one true love. Beyond all of Anderson’s mannered kitsch, <em>this</em> is the kind of thing that has clearly resonated for so many filmmakers since, a kind of artful, playful wistfulness, stylish and deceptively simple, and scored with just the right unexpected song. Anderson’s arch, presentational style is a bit harder to ape without outright copycatting, but the sentiment he brings to some of his films, somehow both crisp and bleary, has been mirrored in immediate descendants like <em>Little Miss Sunshine,</em> <em>Juno,</em> and <em>Garden State,</em> and its longer influence lingers in films like <em>Lady Bird,</em> in glossy television series like <em>Transparent,</em> and in numerous TV commercials and music videos. <em>&#8212;Richard Lawson</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Luke Wilson, “Richie Tenenbaum”</strong></p>\n<p>“That probably would have been one of six or seven things that we shot that day. It just would have said, ‘Margot exits bus, Richie waits for her.’ But then that’s where you see Wes’s qualities, where you slow it down to 16 frames per second and then the great expression that Gwyneth has on her face. You get magic moments like the wind in her hair, and it’s slowed down, and you have Nico singing that beautiful Jackson Browne song. I can remember going to see <em>The Doors</em> with Owen and Wes in Austin, when it had first come out, and there was kind of the cool sequence where the Velvet Underground song “Heroin” was playing through this sequence of Jim Morrison being out of control. Those guys both kind of clenched up because they’d wanted to use the song “Heroin” in something. I’m just sitting there thinking, ‘God this is an incredible movie, what a scene, what a song,’ and they were both like, ‘Dammit, now we can’t use this song.’ These guys haven’t made a movie yet, but you get the feeling they’re in competition with Oliver Stone.” <em>&#8212;As told to Katey Rich</em></p>\n<h2><em>BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE,</em> 2002</h2>\n<h3>Moore vs. Heston</h3>\n<p>You frankly cannot imagine Hollywood&#39;s modern political image without Michael Moore&#8212;and not only because of the steady stream of homegrown, outspoken political documentarians to follow in his stead (including Steve Bannon). Few American filmmakers have seemed as consistently on topic, off their rocker, and simply around as Michael Moore. And <em>Bowling for Columbine,</em> his 2002 testament to a growing national fear over mass gun violence, forged in our collective fury over the Columbine High School massacre, is probably the greatest evidence of that. Here it is, 2019, and we’re still talking about guns.</p>\n<p>It’s a film overstuffed with memorable moments that would leak out into the broader culture: a <em>South Park</em>&#8211;esque animated history of the Second Amendment, a chillingly insightful interview with Marilyn Manson that teases apart just how this outsider came to be a national scapegoat, and so on. But nothing sums up Moore’s mosquito-like knack for annoyance or his delight at the well-timed ambush more vividly than his off-the-walls closing interview with Hollywood great Charlton Heston&#8212;a Rosetta stone moment for the next two decades of national debate, online and in public, between celebrities, civilians, liberals, and conservatives, over gun violence. <em>&#8212;K. Austin Collins</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Michael Moore, director</strong></p>\n<p>“I’m uncomfortable watching the scene now, and I’m uncomfortable sitting there with him. But I wasn’t going to not put it in the film either. He revealed his core beliefs. But I remember feeling kind of sad about it later. Here’s a man who 40 years prior to that marched with Martin Luther King, and now in his elderly years had just turned into this angry white guy who believed that we should have these laws where it’s O.K. to shoot first and ask questions later. When the film came out, the N.R.A. was furious and they spent a lot of money, I think, on surrogates, putting them on newscasts, trying to attack me and attack the film. When they did that, it went on to break the record at the time for box office. When we started making that film there had not been a school shooting like Columbine. We thought, we need to make this film so this doesn’t become a thing. Now mass shootings are almost a daily occurrence. Our mission, I guess, failed.” <em>&#8212;As told to Katey Rich</em></p>\n<h2><em>THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS,</em> 2002</h2>\n<h3>Gollum v. Sméagol</h3>\n<p>Any actor fretting about the encroaching development of real-time motion-capture technology, which might someday make live acting a thing of the past, can look to the brilliant Andy Serkis for blame. Beginning in 2000, Serkis teamed up with director Peter Jackson and Jackson’s FX wonder-house, Weta Workshop, to do something unprecedented. As the tortured cave creature known as Gollum&#8212;once a Stoor Hobbit named Sméagol, since ruined by a magic ring&#8212;Serkis acts against himself, staging a fraught debate between loyalty and murder that is the thrilling highlight of an already plenty-exciting movie. Funny, creepy, and dazzling, the scene helped convince the rest of the industry that not only could motion capture and other digital performance be viable on a technical level, but that, done in real time on set, it could capture a depth of feeling that’s of crucial emotional value to a film. Whether you love or loathe what this scene spelled for the art form in the years that followed, this lonely aria is a thing of true, lasting power. <em>&#8212;Richard Lawson</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Andy Serkis, “Gollum”</strong></p>\n<p>“We began to evolve this whole notion of Sméagol and Gollum being two very different personalities, one of which was the visceral controlling Gollum, but then this schizophrenic feeling toward Frodo and then the power of the ring was manifested by the Sméagol side, who became the younger brother that is manipulated and abused by the elder, brutal kind of sibling. And obviously that came into being fully in that scene. I knew it was a really important scene, you just have the feeling. At the world premiere at the Ziegfeld here in New York in 2002, I just remember when it came to that scene I literally felt the audience all as one lean forward in their seats. As an actor, I’ve never experienced anything like that, or hadn’t at that point. You could hear a pin drop, you could also hear people not kind of understanding&#8212; is this an actor, is it a real person? It felt kind of emotionally real and present. It was really gratifying.” <em>&#8212;As told to Katey Rich</em></p>\n<h2><em>LOST IN TRANSLATION,</em> 2003</h2>\n<h3>Famous Last Words</h3>\n<p>The curiosity of Sofia Coppola’s <em>Lost in Translation</em> is that it wafts into view sure of itself, aware of its heroine’s annoying privileges and poised to see them, not with ridicule, but with curious sympathy. It’s the kind of film that can’t help but feel autobiographical&#8212;in the way that every Coppola feature has to date, to some degree. And nothing in Coppola’s work feels more immediately personal than her style: soft and sharp at once, good-humored, modern, soul-baring. It revived Bill Murray’s career with the kind of pitch-perfect immediacy that hadn’t been seen since John Travolta in <em>Pulp Fiction.</em> And it made a star of the smartly sensuous Scarlett Johansson, who carries this featherweight movie on her shoulders with an invisible grace.</p>\n<p>Had it occurred to young romantics in 2003 that romances needn’t be romances, per se, bogged down with all the tension of sex and emotion, before <em>Lost in Translation</em>? Had any other movie so aptly proven that dramas could end as mysteries, or that self-awareness needn’t be tamped down with self-ridicule? A million indies were born of the dreamy tone of Coppola’s film, and its ambiguous ending&#8212;then so surprising&#8212;has been aped in various forms again and again. <em>&#8212;K. Austin Collins</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Sofia Coppola, writer/director</strong></p>\n<p>“I’m pretty sure it was our last day of shooting. We were exhausted, so I think it helped that they really were saying goodbye. I didn’t intend [the end] to be a big thing. He whispered something between them. It came from the tradition of Italian movies&#8212;they would just say numbers and figure out the dialogue later. [But] then we left it. We never seemed to be able to sum it up. I always liked that Bill Murray says it’s between the two of them.</p>\n<p>[Everybody] asks what he whispers to her. I just don’t get why it’s such a thing, but I’m touched that people feel connected to it.</p>\n<p>I hadn’t seen it for a long time, but I watched it last spring, because we went to Japan on a family trip. We were staying at the Park Hyatt, so I wanted to show [my daughters] the movie. Watching with 8 and 11-year-old girls really changed the way I looked at it. Like, what’s the shot of [Scarlett] in her underwear? [Bill’s] so much older than her. My daughters are raised in such a different generation. When it’s on TV, sometimes I’ll stop and watch it for 15 minutes or something. It’s like an old photo album. It’s fun when it pops up, but I don’t sit down and review my work. I go on and don’t really look back.” <em>&#8212;As told to Yohana Desta</em></p>\n<h2><em>SOMETHING’S GOTTA GIVE,</em> 2003</h2>\n<h3>Erica Writes a Play</h3>\n<p>The story for a while has been that rom-coms are dead, but that isn’t quite true: they’ve simply transformed&#8212;into a genre whose virtues are now typically found in films tailored to older women. No filmmaker is more responsible for this than Nancy Meyers, who in 2003 released the Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson hit <em>Something’s Gotta Give,</em> in which a successful playwright (played by Keaton) falls for her daughter’s new boyfriend&#8212;who happens to be closer to her own age.</p>\n<p>In the silliest, most contagiously funny scene in <em>Something’s Gotta Give,</em> they’ve broken up, and Keaton, leaning in to the fanciful delight of the genre, pulls an all-nighter writing their romance into a new play. It’s memorable for the whole movie being in on the joke, enwrapping Keaton in a whirlwind of tears, as well as for Keaton herself, a veritable hurricane of melodramatic hilarity. From the start, this is a movie with one foot in the door of rom-com serendipity, and another in the unlikelihood of its lead characters being people in their fifties and sixties. And yet, per her style, Meyers dials up the youthful fantasy of the rom-com, allowing not only for the possibility of older romance, but for the possibility of an audience for such romances. <em>&#8212;K. Austin Collins</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Nancy Meyers, writer/director</strong></p>\n<p>“The scene really came more from my life and a relationship that ended that I had, and that was kind of what I was like. I wrote <em>Something’s Gotta Give</em> like that. It wasn’t quite that extreme, but I am supposed to dramatize things. The scene is funny because it never ends. Because of the length of the montage, it’s not just, ‘I’m sitting on my bed with way too many Kleenex’; it’s, ‘Something happened to me that just changed me.’ Throughout the movie up to that point, she’s unclear what her new play is about. This gives her everything to write about. Having that kind of purpose got her through this. Honestly, there’s nobody that could have done it but Diane Keaton. She managed to make you feel the pain she was feeling, and she also made you laugh, within a second of each other.” <em>&#8212;As told to Katey Rich</em></p>\n<h2><em>STAR WARS: EPISODE III-REVENGE OF THE SITH,</em> 2005</h2>\n<h3>“The Chosen One”</h3>\n<p>Not all the films on this list have influenced Hollywood in a positive way. Take the third of George Lucas’s seriously misguided <em>Star Wars</em> prequels, which contains the climactic scene in which a young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) confronts and permanently maims his onetime protégé Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), pushing that wayward Jedi even closer toward becoming Darth Vader. Finally, the circle was completing; this grand space-opera tragedy was getting its full realization. But the scene arrived at the end of so much disappointment, a creative nadir that, even more disappointingly, inspired imitators instead of scaring them off. All of Lucas’s aggressive blue/green-screen technique became frustratingly de rigueur for big-budget spectaculars, even though that cold C.G.I. gleam was something that turned many people off from the franchise. Seven years after <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>’s release, Disney acquired Lucasfilm, and thus the <em>Star Wars</em> universe, setting about course-correcting the film series. That led to 2015’s <em>The Force Awakens,</em> which grossed over $2 billion worldwide. Which isn’t to say that Lucas’s prequels weren’t financially successful in their own right. They absolutely were&#8212;fan-loathed messes that nevertheless introduced a new malleability to time and continuity’s function in franchise filmmaking&#8212;a creative license that studios take more and more each sequelizing and prequelizing year. <em>&#8212;Richard Lawson</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Ewan McGregor, “Obi-Wan Kenobi”</strong></p>\n<p>“<em>Episode III</em> was all green screen: they had us on green disks on a green floor with a green background, and a guy on the floor rotating us like chickens, as we lunged at each other with lightsabers. What keeps you emotionally grounded is the other actor. <em>Episode II,</em> I was on my own, speaking to thin air. But this scene was harrowing for Obi-Wan. I lose Anakin, and we see the danger of what it might lead to in <em>Episodes IV, V, and VI.</em> For all my moaning about green screen, I did enjoy playing Obi-Wan and this link to Alec Guinness. George Lucas wanted to do something very different with the prequels. That’s why people felt cheated. It was upsetting when people would laugh and joke about it. Now, many years later, the prequels meant a lot to the generation that were kids then. So from smirking, cynical opinions, now I’m getting feedback from the kids they were made for. I’m really happy about that.” <em>&#8212;As told to Joanna Robinson</em></p>\n<h2><em>THE 40 YEAR-OLD VIRGIN,</em> 2005</h2>\n<h3>The Chest Wax</h3>\n<p>With one “Oh, Kelly Clarkson!” used in every trailer and TV ad, Judd Apatow’s rambly, improv-y style of comedy&#8212;full of unexpected pop-culture references like Steve Carell’s immortal chest-waxing exclamation&#8212;entered the mainstream in full. That easygoing, friends-shooting-the-shit vibe, peppered with bits of manic high-comedy, would become the standard for the next decade-plus. A zillion films have tapped into that same discursive energy, Apatow’s repertory company all spinning off to do their own things, from superhero movies to Sundance successes. The Apatovian comedy has faded a bit in its primacy in the last year or two, making way for an alt-er, queerer style burbling up out of Twitter and the remnants of mumblecore. But <em>The 40-Year-Old Virgin</em>’s stamp remains significant, a bright and pained declaration of amiable, silly good times. That it was mostly the boys who got to enjoy those good times is maybe part of the reason they now seem to be fading. <em>&#8212;Richard Lawson</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Judd Apatow, writer/director</strong></p>\n<p>“Steve said, ‘Just shoot me actually getting my chest waxed, because I’m very hairy, and I’m sure it would hurt. And it would be funny to see in pain.’ So we hired an actress who claimed to be a professional chest-waxer. When we shot the scene, it seemed pretty clear that she’d lied on her résumé. Steve almost lost one of his two nipples. He was bleeding&#8212;we had to use C.G.I. technology to remove most of the blood, because it was too troubling to look at. Paul [Rudd] was the one who noticed that it was turning into a shape that looked like a Halloween pumpkin. And then as soon as we noticed that he was looking like a man-o’-lantern, we made a point of telling the waxer to continue in that configuration. It was really funny, and it’s all because of how Steve reacts. He’s actually in intense pain, but he completely stays in character, doing jokes while basically being tortured.” <em>&#8212;As told to Hillary Busis</em></p>\n<h2><em>BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN,</em> 2005</h2>\n<h3>“I Wish I Knew How to Quit You”</h3>\n<p>There were queer films before <em>Brokeback Mountain</em>&#8212;there have been queer films since the silent era. But Ang Lee’s 2005 drama, adapted from Annie Proulx’s somber, lyrical short story of the same name, was a significant step forward in the winding, fraught history of queer life in the mainstream. The film starred Jake Gyllenhaal and the late Heath Ledger as a pair of quiet, guarded, temperamental cowboys in love; straight actors in what has otherwise&#8212;given the soaring, masculine landscape and all the Western trappings&#8212;tended to be a straight genre. Queerness had reached Hollywood in a big way: its own classical codes of manhood and romance were being re-written before our eyes.</p>\n<p>Though not, perhaps, without a price. At the emotional climax of the movie comes the line, shouted mid-argument, that quickly became a source of parody: “I wish I knew how to quit you.” Earnest but impossible romance tends to have that effect on people, and the line sums up the films predicament handsomely. Whereas at first these men’s romance was obscured by the furtiveness of secrets and time stolen away, here was their affection being announced out loud, in the open, with nature bearing witness. It’s part of a one-two gut punch that includes the film’s tragic ending, all of it very canny. Here, to be sure, was a sign of Hollywood’s progress in action. And here, as well, was a testament to its limits. <em>&#8212;K. Austin Collins</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Ang Lee, director</strong></p>\n<p>“That scene was actually [shot] in a reservoir, in a small parking place. It has the best view of this Canadian mountain. There was snow, there was water&#8212;it was perfect.</p>\n<p>“I remember building up to that [scene], I did something weird with the camera, kept moving it, to freak [Ledger and Gyllenhaal] out a little bit. Keep them fresh. It was a rough shoot for the actors, I would say. Heath was very intense; he didn’t want a lot of distraction. He was just very specific about the goal he wants to hit. Jake, on the other side, he was very young, at times naughty, experimental. That would drive Heath crazy sometimes . . . [but] in one take, Jake hit it. That speech came from one take. It was beautiful, but they didn’t believe me. Actors, they’re all skeptical.</p>\n<p>“The reason I wanted to do the movie is that one line: ‘All we have is Brokeback.’ It’s not even that line [‘I wish I knew how to quit you’]. I questioned <em>that</em> line in the script. ‘Is that too much?’ Everybody picked that line up. None of us expected it.” <em>&#8212;As told to Yohana Desta</em></p>\n<h2><em>CHILDREN OF MEN,</em> 2006</h2>\n<h3>The Ambush</h3>\n<p>The impressively choreographed long takes that have overtaken mainstream movies seem mostly to have one of two major influences: Martin Scorsese’s free-flowing introduction to the inner workings of the Copacabana in <em>Goodfellas,</em> and Alfonso Cuarón’s <em>Children of Men</em>&#8212;which features a handful of such impressive shots, including its six-and-a-half-minute-long climax shot in which Clive Owen tumbles through a fearsome battle. But it’s an earlier sequence, in which Owen, Julianne Moore, and their fellow travelers are ambushed on an idyllic Canterbury road, that establishes the frantic, anxiety-producing potential of the form. It’s the kind of shot we now see again and again, parodied and not, in films as technically accomplished as Alejandro González Iñárritu’s <em>The Revenant</em> and HBO’s <em>True Detective.</em> It set a standard for showing off.</p>\n<p><em>Children of Men,</em> released in 2006, set a new high bar for science-fiction filmmaking, which is saying something for a genre that, thanks to the likes of Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, and George Lucas (to say nothing of Stanley Kubrick), is constantly breaking the mold of blockbuster filmmaking. Cuarón’s was a project for a new era&#8212;grittier, for one thing, as well as a deft combination of entertainment and ideas, action and mythology. The long take is its loudest accomplishment. <em>&#8212;K. Austin Collins</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Emmanuel “Chivo” Lubezki, cinematographer</strong></p>\n<p>“Obviously, everybody thought we should do [it] in C.G. And for a couple of months, we were all satisfied with the main idea. But every time I thought about it, something felt really weird and wrong. Something told me that shooting that scene in green scene was going against everything else that we’d done. By doing tests, I realized that if I was able to hang the camera from the roof of the car, maybe I could do the entire shot in one shot. That was important, because it’s a way of immersing the audience&#8212;and also not glamorizing violence. By doing everything in real time, I think you feel the desperation and the claustrophobia of the characters. It’s a very long story, but I found all these pieces that were made for other things. I came back to Los Angeles, and we put together this thing that’s called the H dolly on top of a car. And in only one week, we put together this thing that nobody has ever done before.” <em>&#8212;As told to Krista Smith</em></p>\n<h2><em>THERE WILL BE BLOOD,</em> 2007</h2>\n<h3>“I Drink Your Milkshake!”</h3>\n<p>By 2007, with the likes of <em>Boogie Nights, Punch-Drunk Love,</em> and the manically ambitious <em>Magnolia</em> already under his belt, Paul Thomas Anderson had more or less fulfilled his promise as a standard-bearer for the next generation of Serious American Moviemaking. And then came <em>There Will Be Blood</em>&#8212;and with it, the searing-hot Daniel Plainview, instantly one of the most unforgettable characters in the history of American movies.</p>\n<p>You can read the hot-tempered, damnedly secular, unforgiving oil tycoon as America’s will incarnate, with all its mangled, festering vices and virtues summed up in Plainview’s overdetermined mustache and devilish glare. But Daniel Day-Lewis, who brings him to life, makes it impossible to see him solely as symbol or abstraction. This is a film about a performance&#8212;a movie that gets bigger, wilder, as the man at its center does. In the movie’s brutal final moments, Plainview, dilapidated with corruption, jumps the rails of his sanity and delivers a coup de grâce of an ending that remains unusually bold for American filmmaking. “I drink your milkshake,” he says, relishing the deviance of his business plan&#8212;just before beating America, the spiritual symbol, to death. It’s an earth-shattering high point in both the actor’s and director’s careers&#8212;big acting and big auteurism for a generation of movies that was beginning to forget them. <em>&#8212;K. Austin Collins</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Dylan Tichenor, Editor</strong></p>\n<p>“We didn’t have a really good ending. Paul had written a few different scenes; very early in the scripting, there was a reporter coming to talk to Daniel at his mansion, and that didn’t fly. The end of the movie just didn’t seem to have a point. Once the part of Eli Sunday was re-cast and it became Paul Dano, it turned into a totally different character. The milkshake line&#8212;I think everyone cocked their head and laughed when they read it, like, ‘What?’ Daniel is an amazing actor, and has a bit of a crazy process, and he just completely glommed on to that moment. He’s got to ramp up the energy and his anger and his character’s desperation, up to the point where he can kill Paul Dano’s character. I wanted the scene to be very surprising and just grip you by the throat. It’s a ludicrous ending. I mean, it’s crazy. It’s unexpected. But for that kind of movie, it’s the right ending. Anything less spectacular would be a bit of a letdown.” <em>&#8212;As told to Hillary Busis</em></p>\n<h2><em>IRON MAN,</em> 2008</h2>\n<h3>But Wait . . .</h3>\n<p>The first film in Kevin Feige’s role as head of production for Marvel Studios didn’t invent the post-credits sequence. But it turned it into a hallowed ritual, an extra, even <em>more</em> niche bit of fan service than what the main feature has just offered up. The first one came with <em>Iron Man,</em> in which snappy Robert Downey Jr., playing Tony Stark, meets Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), who intimates that a whole Avengers team may someday be assembled. Of course, said team was put together, and now everyone stays for at least the mid-credits bit after all of these movies&#8212;whether they’re from Marvel or not. Fans who get the references hoot with knowing satisfaction, while the uninitiated experience a reluctant tingle of curiosity that something even grander may be on its way. Most post-credits scenes are totally unnecessary, but they are nonetheless tradition now, because we have given so much of the world to the geeks that we’ll now sit as the names of thousands of strangers roll by, just to see a little more. <em>&#8212;Richard Lawson</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Samuel L. Jackson, “Nick Fury”</strong></p>\n<p>“I was there maybe an hour and a half, because I think at that time, I had my own mustache and goatee. Having been a comic-book fan my whole life, and knowing who Nick Fury was and the history of it, to go into a comic-book store and see myself on a comic book was like, ‘Wait a minute. This is awesome.’ And if that had been what it was, that would have been fine. But actually, it bred a real presence beyond anything I could have imagined. It’s been a real joy to be able to hang out with all of these superheroes and find out who they are, find out how Nick Fury fits in their world, without having a particular superpower&#8212;other than being very persuasive. It’s pure joy. Doing <em>Iron Man</em> was the initial step for me to [get to] a space of, ‘O.K., how do I want to present him? Is he cool? Is he rough? Is he harsh? Is he humane?’ Finding that sweet spot that’s going to make people care about how he is, and want him to be a part of that universe.” <em>&#8212;As told to Julie Miller</em></p>\n<h2><em>THE DARK KNIGHT,</em> 2008</h2>\n<h3>“The Hero Gotham Deserves”</h3>\n<p>The history of the American blockbuster, and the superhero movie specifically, has played out in phases. If Tim Burton’s 1989 <em>Batman</em> was the beginning of one, ushering in a new, long era of mainstream U.S. action movies, then Christopher Nolan’s <em>The Dark Knight</em> was the beginning of another: it marked the point when the genre grew up&#8212;or tried to.</p>\n<p>The history of the superhero movie is still, by and large, a conflict between the well-oiled Marvel aesthetic and the broodier DC mood, which has had fits and starts, and which obviously tried to take a cue from Nolan’s book. <em>The Dark Knight</em> was no Tim Burton <em>Batman,</em> nor was it the comparatively airy and kid-friendly confines of Sam Raimi’s <em>Spider-Man</em> films. Nolan’s movie had more in common with Michael Mann than with the world of Adam West; his Joker, a live scorcher on-screen played by Heath Ledger, was more unpredictable anarchist than rote movie villain. The action set pieces and script had more heft; the style was harder, toned down. Commissioner Gordon’s closing salvo about “the hero Gotham deserves” would sum all of that up mightily, giving the <em>Batman</em> universe&#8212;and superhero movies, with it&#8212;a dramatic maturity, a rock-steady sense of mythology, that the genre to that point lacked. This isn’t just a superhero movie. That speech says: this is the film made to convince us that they will last. <em>&#8212;K. Austin Collins</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Hans Zimmer, composer</strong></p>\n<p>“I told Chris the music was too loud&#8212;you couldn’t hear the lines. He said, ‘I wrote them. I can do what I want.’ He was right; people do remember the lines. He could have done 200 different cop-out endings, but he put that ending on. It’s hard to pull off a satisfying ending, if you’re that ambiguous. One second longer, or one sentence or note different, and it would have been a different movie. When Heath Ledger was cast, there was an outcry from an audience, forgetting that it’s not for us to ask what they want to see&#8212;it’s for us to make something they can’t even imagine. It’s a Batman movie, but not what you imagine a Batman movie to be. And it surprised everyone. Isn’t that what you’re supposed to do?” <em>&#8212;As told to Joanna Robinson</em></p>\n<h2><em>TWILIGHT,</em> 2008</h2>\n<h3>When Edward Met Bella</h3>\n<p>With one longing and curious look across a high-school cafeteria&#8212;human Bella (Kristen Stewart) clocking vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson)&#8212;the Y.A. boom was crystallized. It may have been a short-lived craze, peaking with the <em>The Hunger Games</em> and sputtering out with the <em>Divergent</em> series. But in that brief time, <em>Twilight</em> fever reshaped our understanding of youth culture, and turned the industry’s gaze toward fan corners of the Internet, in search of the emo heart that gave life to a generation. It shouldn’t go without mentioning that the majority of those fans were young women, whose ardency and buying power could not be denied. We can thank this scene for <em>Fifty Shades of Grey,</em> though its effect may be better felt on television these days, where appealing to fandom is vital to many networks’ strategies. <em>Twilight</em> also launched Stewart and Pattinson to stardom, though both have since shaken off the teen-idol trappings and become bold indie-film explorers. <em>&#8212;Richard Lawson</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Catherine Hardwicke, director</strong></p>\n<p>“We all knew that Rob and Kristen were more indie spirits in a way, because [of] the way they dressed, what they read, what music they listened to, what movies they liked. They weren’t just super-big, popular-movie type people. I guess the fact that they did not know this was going to be this big, crazy, mainstream juggernaut&#8212;they knew me a little bit from <em>Thirteen</em> and <em>Lords of Dogtown.</em> They knew I would have that sensibility. If <em>Twilight</em> was known to be a blockbuster, it wouldn’t be a female director. I think they trusted me, exploring this first love, but nobody thought it would turn into this crazy-worldwide-blockbuster insanity. The good thing is that it gave them enough worldwide cred and clout that they could green-light all these super-interesting films later in their careers. I think it’s an amazing ripple effect.” <em>&#8212;As told to Katey Rich</em></p>\n<h2><em>FAST FIVE,</em> 2011</h2>\n<h3>The Favela Chase</h3>\n<p><em>Fast Five</em> is best thought of as a point of transition. Set entirely in Rio de Janeiro, this is the movie that brought the series into its second phase of familial sentimentality and go-for-broke action set pieces. And, perhaps more important, it’s the movie in the series that introduces Luke Hobbs, played by Vin Diesel’s ideal action foil: Dwayne Johnson, who is now, thanks in no small part to the <em>Fast</em> series, one of the biggest action stars in the country. The movie is full of classic set pieces and the vigorous mix of humor and action that would come to define the rest of the franchise, as would its remarkably diverse cast and roster of directors. But the favela chase, pitter-pattering across the hot, slippery rooftops of a poor Rio neighborhood, effectively sums up the movie’s role in the broader franchise, becoming something new while remaining true to what it is. <em>&#8212;K. Austin Collins</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Vin Diesel, “Dominic Toretto”</strong></p>\n<p>“I remember Adam Fogelson, who was running the studio at the time, and Donna Langley, they were really kind of excited about going bigger and bigger. Their mantra was you guys don’t have capes, but we’re the proletariat superheroes. We need to start delivering that. The foundation of the family and brotherhood are so strong, now what we have to do is focus on the spectacle and kind of one-upping each film in terms of the spectacle and wish fulfillment and enjoyment of watching the scenes. I remember when we were in the favelas in Rio, the police were saying, ‘You guys are safer than the police.’ Everyone would open up their doors and they would offer whatever they had. We were for the people, we were representing the people. We were saying despite where you come from you can be empowered, you can be effective, you can have your own code and you can be honorable. That’s something I remember like yesterday.” <em>&#8212;As told to Katey Rich</em></p>\n<h2><em>GET OUT,</em> 2017</h2>\n<h3>The Sunken Place</h3>\n<p>There’d been horror films about race before (<em>Candyman</em> and <em>The People Under the Stairs</em> both come to mind), but none distilled and furthered the American conversation about race, or (re)introduced socially conscious horror with quite as lively a style or contagious a concept, the way <em>Get Out</em> does. Jordan Peele’s 2017 fire-starter was a mega-hit that proved, like <em>Hidden Figures</em> before it and <em>Black Panther</em> after, there was an untapped black audience currently being underserved by Hollywood.</p>\n<p>And the concept&#8212;a sly merging of the classic American race drama <em>Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner</em> with the plastic horror of <em>The Stepford Wives</em>&#8212;managed to spur an unanticipated rush of memes and references online and throughout the culture. Nothing traveled further or enriched the culture more vividly than “the sunken place,” and the scene of the sunken place itself, a slow-motion vacuum of racialized horror shot through with a bolt of light that sets Daniel Kaluuya’s screaming face ablaze with existential meaning. The idea of the sunken place on its own is good, but it wouldn’t be nearly as effective without the sleek, wondrous design of this scene, which perfectly performs the black terror at the heart of Peele’s movie. With any luck, the history of American movies will never recover from this knockout punch. <em>&#8212;K. Austin Collins</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p><strong>Jordan Peele, writer/director</strong></p>\n<p>“I always had this concept of the place that you’re falling toward when you’re going to sleep, and you get that falling sensation and catch yourself. And if you didn’t catch yourself, where would you end up? I had this hellish image, and I thought of this idea of, ‘What if you were in a place, and you could look through your own eyes as if they were literal windows or a screen, and see what your body was seeing, but feel like a prisoner in your own mind&#8212;the chamber of your mind?’ The moment I thought of that, it immediately occurred to me the theme of abduction and connection to the prison industrial complex that this movie was sort of presenting a metaphor for. It was a very emotional discovery. I remember having so much fun writing it, but at that moment when I figured out this weird, esoteric, but also emotionally brutal form of suffering to put the character through&#8212;I literally cried writing the scene.” <em>&#8212;As told to Julie Miller</em></p>","rubric":"From the Magazine","socialTitle":"The 25 Most Influential Movie Scenes of the Past 25 Years","socialDescription":"Vanity Fair‘s film critics on the scenes that have defined our era.

Both lived on the same block on the Upper East Side. More notably, both were crucial supporting players in the Trump orbit. Cohen had been an indefatigable booster of <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> helping to arrange his real-estate deals, paying off alleged mistresses, and quashing would-be damaging stories regarding his boss. Wolkoff, for a time, was a lesser-known, but equally diligent enforcer for <strong>Melania Trump.</strong></p>\n<p>The two women had met years earlier, when Wolkoff helped produce the Metropolitan Museum’s Costume Institute Benefit. (<strong>Anna Wintour,</strong> who hosts the gala, is editor-in-chief of <em>Vogue</em> and the artistic director of Condé Nast, <em>Vanity Fair</em>’s parent company.) Over the years, Wolkoff would become a member of Melania’s small inner circle. After Trump’s surprise electoral-college victory, she went on to help the First Lady in Washington, serving as a senior adviser to her official governmental office on matters large and small. Wolkoff helped facilitate Melania’s transition to the White House, and advised her on policy platforms, East Wing décor, and her overall messaging.</p>\n<p>The two were close enough that Wolkoff could openly express divergent views. According to sources familiar with the conversations, Wolkoff told Melania and East Wing staffers that the name for her anti-bullying initiative, “Be Best,” sounded illiterate. (The First Lady, according to these sources, feared that an alternative, “Children First,” was too similar to her husband’s “America First” branding.) They also disagreed about the infamous “I Really Don’t Care, Do U?” jacket that the First Lady wore to the U.S.-Mexico border. (Melania, according to these sources, thought the trip would not get attention without such a brazen fashion gesture. In an interview with ABC News in October, she said that she wore the jacket for the media and people who were criticizing her, and wondered aloud whether the trip would have received similar attention without it.) But the two women remained close, nevertheless. On trips to D.C., Wolkoff would sometimes spend the night in the White House residence; other times, she would book a room in the Trump International Hotel down Pennsylvania Avenue. According to e-mail exchanges from the time, she was given the friends and family rate of $345 a night, and told to submit receipts to <strong>Reince Priebus.</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/c97a4730-bc95-4032-b21a-a970764c038c?customColor=%23ff0000\"><iframe height=\"220\" width=\"750\" src=\"https://shows.cadence13.com/player/inside-the-hive/episodes/c97a4730-bc95-4032-b21a-a970764c038c?customColor=%23ff0000\"></iframe></div></div></div><p><strong><em>iTunes user?

Cohen, of course, went from being one of the president’s closest confidants to one of his most bitter and dangerous adversaries. Wolkoff’s separation was less public, but is increasingly newsworthy. Through her company, WIS Media Partners, Wolkoff oversaw Trump’s sprawling week-long inaugural festivities&#8212;she sourced and managed third-party vendors, entertainers, and broadcasters, and oversaw the themes and production of all the concerts, dinners, balls, and programming. She worked in close proximity to the Trump family and inaugural chair <strong>Tom Barrack,</strong> a billionaire private-equity real-estate investor who had been a close friend of the president for years. And yet a year after the swearing-in ceremony, Wolkoff left the White House amid an uncomfortable public-relations crisis regarding the president’s inaugural committee.</p>\n<p>Last February, <em>The New York Times</em> published an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/us/politics/trumps-inaugural-committee-paid-26-million-to-first-ladys-friend.html\">article</a> centered on WIS, headlined “Trump’s Inaugural Committee Paid $26 million to Firm of First Lady’s Adviser.” The inaugural committee had raised a stunning $107 million&#8212;about twice what <strong>Barack Obama</strong> had hauled in 2009&#8212;from donors such as <strong>Sheldon Adelson</strong> and corporations like AT&amp;T. But as the <em>Times</em> reported, the tax form revealed profligate spending&#8212;nearly $10 million on travel; $4.6 million on salaries and benefits; and $100,000 to <strong>Rick Gates,</strong> the former campaign aide and deputy chairman of the inauguration who, about a week later, became one of <strong>Robert Mueller’s</strong> first major cooperating witnesses. Some $40 million was publicly unaccounted for. Wolkoff, as the event planner in charge, became the face of the disarray. The <em>Times</em> story quoted an official from a government watchdog group accusing the inaugural committee of “fiscal mismanagement at its worst.”</p>\n<p>Privately, Wolkoff refuted the characterization. According to bank statements, checks, and internal documents that I’ve reviewed, the $26 million in payment to WIS was largely distributed to third-party vendors and labor. Nearly $24 million was paid for projects related to the work of a subcontractor, Inaugural Productions, an independent organization run by individuals formerly associated with television producer <strong>Mark Burnett,</strong> which was responsible for staging several events. Around $1.6 million was used to compensate 15 contract workers who worked with Wolkoff as staffers. Wolkoff herself received $500,000 for her work on the inauguration. She had submitted audited records to the inauguration committee in March 2017, a month after she signed a gratuitous-services contract to work as an unpaid strategist and senior adviser to the First Lady.</p>\n<p>After the <em>Times</em> article, given her established documentation, Wolkoff urged Melania to defend her. But the administration demurred. <strong>Stephanie Grisham,</strong> the First Lady’s spokesperson, wrote in an e-mail, “This messaging is the best way to go in order to minimize the negative press stories of today and protect FLOTUS &amp; this administration.” A week later, Wolkoff left the East Wing after the White House instilled new security protocols in the wake of the <strong>Rob Porter</strong> scandal. A member of the White House Counsel’s Office called her on February 20, 2018, to let her know that the White House would be terminating all gratuitous-services agreements, including hers. It had nothing to do with her work on the inauguration, this person told her. “I am sorry that the professional part of our relationship has come to an end, but I am comforted in the fact that our [friendship] far outweigh[s] politics,” Melania wrote her in an e-mail later that day. “Thank you Again! Much love.”</p>\n<p>Later that evening, in a phone call, Wolkoff told the First Lady that she worried it appeared as if she had been fired on account of her work on the inauguration. The First Lady urged her not to be “dramatic.” Less than a week later, however, the <em>Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/us/politics/melania-trump-inauguration-adviser.html\">published a story</a> stating that the severance of Wolkoff’s contract had been “prompted by displeasure from the Trumps” over the $26 million payment. Grisham told the <em>Times</em> that Melania “had no involvement” with the inaugural committee, and “had no knowledge of how funds were spent.” The president would create similar distance. <strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders</strong> would later say, “The president was focused on the transition during that time, and not on any of the planning for the inauguration.” (A spokeswoman for the First Lady declined to comment for this story, as did the White House.)</p>\n<p>By the time Cohen and Wolkoff spoke last summer, she had returned to her life in New York. He would soon plead guilty to eight counts in a federal courthouse downtown. But Cohen let Wolkoff know that, among other documents and recordings, the F.B.I. had seized hours of their own conversations that he had taped. According to people familiar with the recordings, some of the taped conversations dealt directly with the inauguration. In them, Wolkoff detailed her own contemporaneous concerns with the inauguration&#8212;about how money was being spent, the general chaos of the process, and the involvement of Trump’s adult children. During these conversations, Wolkoff also raised her issues with the two men in charge of the committee: Gates and Barrack.</p>\n<p>These recordings, in part, led the Southern District of New York to launch a criminal investigation into how the inaugural committee spent its record $107 million. Now, the investigation appears to be advancing. In December, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-inauguration-spending-under-criminal-investigation-by-federal-prosecutors-11544736455\"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/us/politics/trump-inauguration-investigation.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a> reported that prosecutors are examining the committee’s spending, and investigating whether foreign donors from nations including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates funneled money to the committee in an effort to influence U.S. policy. On Monday, the inaugural committee received a subpoena from the S.D.N.Y. requesting documents related to spending and donors, vendors, and benefits handed out, as well as documents related to a wealthy donor who had once registered as a foreign agent working on behalf of the Sri Lankan government. The <em>Journal</em> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-inauguration-spending-under-criminal-investigation-by-federal-prosecutors-11544736455\">reported</a> that prosecutors have asked Gates about the inaugural fund’s spending and its donors. (<strong>Lorin Reisner</strong>, an attorney for Wolkoff, said in a statement: “Stephanie is not going to comment on these reports. She remains proud of her work on the inauguration, and we are confident that her conduct was proper in all respects.” Cohen did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>The subpoena is the latest sign that, while the Mueller investigation could be winding down, the Southern District may be probing a variety of Trump-adjacent avenues into the foreseeable future. An inquiry into the inauguration might also be acutely poignant, given Trump’s concurrent association with both his business and his incoming administration in its earliest days. It involved big money and outside influence. And it involved the Trump family in intimate, important ways. Wolkoff, suddenly and unexpectedly, could find herself in the middle of the maelstrom.</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Wolkoff had made a career in the events business, but she knew from the outset the inauguration would be a unique, and uniquely Trumpian, experience. First, she was a political novice who knew little about what an inauguration entailed. Then, there was Trump’s controversial reputation. Upon accepting the post on the Friday after his election, Wolkoff quickly reached out to her network of vendors. Most of them, according to people familiar with these conversations, resisted the opportunity to work with Trump. Even Burnett, who Trump enlisted to conjure up reality-show-like gimmicks (such as flying a gaggle of drones over the crowd), wanted to keep his involvement private. (Burnett did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>Moreover, and perhaps not surprisingly, Trump’s family wanted to be involved in certain aspects of the coordination. Part of this, of course, was because they were going to be included in many of the events and, logistically, they had to know where to be and what to wear. It was also because Trump’s adult children have always been involved in affairs pertaining to their father, from his businesses to <em>The Apprentice</em> to his campaign. Each week, Wolkoff met with senior inaugural-committee members to present itemized, detailed updates on the status of her planning and financial reports from each vendor and for each event. She was also making regular presentations to Trump, Melania, and the Trump family about various decisions, so that they could weigh in. (White House spokespeople have previously denied that the Trumps were involved in any planning, and said they knew little about the events.) Trump and <strong>Ivanka</strong> were briefed on Burnett’s drone idea, for instance, after they had met with singer <strong>Andrea Bocelli</strong> in his office in Trump Tower about the possibility of him singing at an event. (The Italian tenor did not end up performing.)</p>\n<p>Trump was focused on the big-picture theatrics. He wanted to arrive on the Mall in a military plane with a military escort, much as he had arrived for tapings of <em>The Apprentice</em> on Trump Organization helicopters. He also wanted to have a full military parade, as well as tanks and helicopters on the ground. Ivanka, meanwhile, had more particular interests, according to e-mail and text exchanges and people familiar with the conversations. Originally, Ivanka wanted to host an event for women on the Wednesday before her father’s swearing-in ceremony. (The plan was ultimately scrapped.) To be helpful, she suggested a photographer who had once shot her for <em>Town &amp; Country</em> as someone who could take the official family portrait. She also offered a D.J. friend of hers from New York as a possible performer. She texted photos of the Obama family standing onstage together, with <strong>Sasha</strong> and <strong>Malia</strong> prominently situated in the middle of the frame. “FYI regarding the swearing in, it is nice to have family with him for this special moment,” she wrote.</p>\n<p>In large part, Wolkoff worried about potential ethical issues surrounding the First Family-elect and their businesses. After all, Gates had been staying in a suite at the Trump Hotel for most of the inaugural planning. More than a dozen inaugural staffers had also been staying there. The <em>Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/trump-inauguration-spending.html\">reported</a> last month that WIS alone had charged $31,000 for hotel rooms in the span of less than two months, including almost $18,000 at the Trump International Hotel. That did not include what was charged for room service, meals, and travel. In all, the Trump International Hotel was paid more than $1.5 million in inaugural funds, according to the <em>Times.</em> (Wolkoff’s contract states that the inaugural committee would reimburse WIS for travel, long-distance phone calls, mail-delivery services, and expenses connected to the performance of its work. WIS stands for “Who Is She,” Wolkoff’s play on her own anonymity.)</p>\n<p>During the course of planning, Wolkoff had corresponded with Ivanka about the cost of using the Trump Hotel for events leading up to the swearing-in ceremony. On December 10, 2016, a Trump Organization employee sent an estimate for a ballroom rental and food and beverage minimum to use the Trump Hotel space for eight days. The price she quoted was $3.6 million, according to an e-mail. A week later, Gates e-mailed Ivanka about the cost. In this exchange, first <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-trumps-inauguration-paid-trumps-company-with-ivanka-in-the-middle\">published</a> this past December by ProPublica and WNYC, Wolkoff flagged her concern. “These events are in PE’s [the president-elect’s] honor at his hotel and one of them is for family and close friends. Please take into consideration that when this is audited it will become public knowledge,” she wrote. (<strong>Peter Mirijanian,</strong> a spokesperson for Ivanka’s counsel <strong>Abbe Lowell,</strong> said in a statement: “When contacted by someone working on the inauguration, Ms. Trump passed the inquiry on to a hotel official and said only that any resulting discussions should be at a ‘fair market rate.’ Ms. Trump was not involved in any additional discussions.”)</p>\n<p>For an event producer used to detailed lists and punctilious itemization, Wolkoff was often caught off guard by the ad-hoc nature of the committee. According to the two people familiar with the matter, Gates approached a couple individuals working on the inauguration and asked if they would be willing to be paid directly for their work by a donor, rather than by the inaugural committee. They had received more donations than they’d initially anticipated, Gates told these people. Skirting the usual payment route could allow the inaugural committee to avoid reporting the full amount raised from donors. (A lawyer for Gates did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>Wolkoff frequently told Melania about her concerns regarding Gates, these people said. She relayed her concern about the high access level of his security pass within Trump Tower and his closeness with the Trump family. In her view, these people said, he exacerbated a situation already fraught with potential conflicts of interest. Members of the inaugural committee talked about how he frequently worked out of <strong>Donald Trump Jr.’s</strong> office. He was in constant communication with the adult children in order to keep them in the loop about decisions surrounding the inauguration.</p>\n<p>Wolkoff also questioned Gates and Barrack about pricing and budgets across the board, according to the people familiar with the conversations. She started to grow concerned about being left out of meetings, particularly as she raised more red flags. Because part of her responsibilities included reviewing all budgets from her vendors and presenting them to other members of the inaugural committee, she studied the line items in order to be able to explain them. At points, she could not justify the numbers coming in. After circulation of a quote from one of their largest event-production vendors, Hargrove LLC, Wolkoff was shocked that no one in the organization appeared willing to question the figures. She suggested that the quote seemed far beyond what the Obama inaugural committee would have been charged in 2009. She sent an e-mail to her team and Barrack on December 31, 2016. “I am DISGUSTED by [Hargrove’s] lack of transparency and entitlement to [the Presidential Inaugural Committee’s] funding,” she wrote. “I can not approve any budget line items because I do not have a clue what these numbers represent!!” (Hargrove did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n<p>One of the most concerning aspects to Wolkoff’s team, according to the people familiar with the situation, was the amount of money and attention being spent on Barrack’s chairman dinner, which he hosted on an evening before the swearing-in. A draft guest list for the event from days before the dinner included the likes of retired Lieutenant General <strong>Mike Flynn,</strong> G.O.P. fund-raiser <strong>Elliott Broidy,</strong> Michael Cohen, and key officials in the incoming administration. Among the list marked as confirmed were seven people described as “foreign ministers” for Saudi Arabia, one foreign minister from Qatar, and one from the United Arab Emirates. They were the only people on the list who were unnamed. (On Tuesday, ProPublica <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-tom-barrack-colony-company-of-trump-inaugural-chair-sought-to-profit\">published</a> a memo that showed Barrack’s investment firm planned to profit from its connections to the Trump administration. A spokesperson called it “an outline of a proposed potential business plan which was never acted upon or implemented.”)</p>\n<p>A spokesman for Barrack declined to comment, but pointed me toward comments Barrack made in a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/chairmans-global-dinner-most-exclusive-event-preceding-trump-inauguration-1484571781\"><em>Journal</em> report</a> published days before the inauguration. “The evening is intended to be the president-elect’s first fingerprint on the global canvas of social democracy and outreach,” Barrack said at the time, explaining that the evening was set up to reach out to local international diplomats and create a “hopeful tapestry of international cooperation and respect.”</p>\n</section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>Much has been made of the various problems with the inauguration, from the lackluster crowd size to the president’s own “American carnage” speech, which struck a tone so dark that <strong>George W. Bush</strong> was reportedly heard calling it “some weird shit.” But Wolkoff’s part, the event itself, went off without a hitch, and the family was pleased. The day after the swearing-in ceremony was Wolkoff’s birthday. The Trumps sent flowers to the Trump Hotel room where she had been staying. She flew back to New York on a military plane with Melania, her stylist, hairdresser, makeup artist, and the rest of the Trump family, apart from the president, Ivanka, and <strong>Jared Kushner,</strong> who remained in Washington.</p>\n<p>Much is still unknown about how inaugural funds were managed, or if the unaccounted for $40-odd million will ever be publicly explained. It’s unclear whether there was foreign influence, or illicit attempts to profit off of proceedings. What Gates has offered investigators&#8212;about anything, really, but about the inauguration, in particular&#8212;is also unclear. How deep the Southern District’s investigation into all of this is yet unknown. But much like some of Cohen’s other taped conversations, the discussions with Wolkoff about the inauguration may have turned out to be consequential. On the witness stand during <strong>Paul Manafort’s</strong> trial in Virginia last summer, prosecutors asked Gates if he charged personal expenses to the committee. “It’s possible,” he responded.</p>\n<p>As investigators continue to pursue the matter, they may find themselves in a familiar situation: seeking out former Trump allies-turned-adversaries who saw it all go down firsthand. One of the most inexplicable plot points in the whirling Trump drama has been the president’s public treatment of his former lawyer. Trump was aware that Cohen possessed all manner of damaging information about him, and yet he wasted few opportunities to disparage him publicly. Ultimately, Cohen implicated Trump in federal campaign-finance violations as he pleaded guilty. He spent more than 70 hours cooperating with federal investigators, opening his book to tell them what he knew about the president, his business, and the campaign. While Wolkoff’s treatment has been gentler, she’s been similarly isolated and publicly disparaged. And now, what she knows could be of interest to investigators, too.</p>\n<p><em>This story has been updated to reflect Mark Burnett&#39;s connection to Inaugural Productions.</em></p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>\n</section>","rubric":"Trump’s World","socialTitle":"“I Am Disgusted”: Behind the Scenes of Trump’s $107 Million Inauguration","socialDescription":"Stephanie Winston Wolkoff was the mastermind event producer behind Trump’s inaugural celebration, which has since come under S.D.N.Y. investigation.

That is why I unequivocally apologize,” she wrote, while maintaining that the role of lobbying groups in Washington is “problematic,” and “we must be willing to address it.”</p>\n<p>Omar drew fire from Democrats Monday for allegedly leaning into <a href=\"https://www.jweekly.com/2013/04/12/jews-and-money-the-stereotype-the-history-the-reality-jccsf-series-explores/\">harmful stereotypes</a> when she accused Rep. <strong>Kevin McCarthy</strong> of being under the influence of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. (“It’s all about the Benjamins, baby,” she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ilhanmn/status/1094747501578633216\">tweeted</a>, implying AIPAC had nudged McCarthy into censuring her for comments critical of Israel.) Jewish committee chairs <strong>Jerry Nadler, Eliot Engel,</strong> and <strong>Ted Deutch</strong> condemned her tweet, while two other Jewish representatives&#8212;<strong>Josh Gottheimer</strong> and <strong>Elaine Luria</strong>&#8212;circulated a letter expressing their alarm by “recent rhetoric from certain members.”</p>\n<p>Leadership, apparently, was listening. In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/desiderioDC/status/1095025394011553798\">statement</a> released early Monday afternoon, the entirety of the Democratic leadership&#8212;House Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader <strong>Steny Hoyer</strong> chief among them&#8212;unanimously called for Omar to “immediately apologize for these hurtful comments,” a remarkable rebuke. “Anti-Semitism must be called out, confronted, and condemned whenever it is encountered, without exception,” they wrote, affirming that they encouraged “legitimate criticism of Israel’s policies” on free-speech grounds. “But Congresswoman Omar’s use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel’s supporters is deeply offensive.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1095046561254567937\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1095046561254567937\">https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1095046561254567937</a></p></blockquote></div><p>The wrist-slap might not have come at all, had this been Omar’s first offense. But the Minnesota representative has faced backlash before for remarks pertaining to Israel. In a 2012 tweet, she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ilhanmn/status/269488770066313216\">wrote</a> that Israel has “hypnotized the world” and prayed that “Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.” When the tweet <a href=\"https://www.jta.org/2018/07/09/politics/muslim-candidate-congress-calls-israel-apartheid-regime\">resurfaced in 2018</a>, Omar, a Somali refugee, defended her statement by arguing that the two were not equivalent: “Drawing attention to the apartheid Israeli regime is far from hating Jews.” After she assumed office and the scrutiny intensified, she claimed ignorance (“I don’t know how my comments would be offensive to Jewish Americans,” she <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/issues/omar-defends-anti-israel-tweet-i-dont-know-how-my-comments-could-be-offensive-to-jewish-americans/\">told</a> CNN’s <strong>Poppy Harlow</strong> in January), and later said she was still learning. “I was like, ‘Do not call me that, that’s not what I was doing.’ And I was like, ‘Oh, I see what you’re saying now,’” she <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/ilhan-omar-addresses-anti-israel-comments-on-daily-show\">told</a> <em>The Daily Show</em>’s <strong>Trevor Noah</strong> earlier this month. “So I had to take a deep breath and understand where people were coming from and what point they were trying to make, which is what I expect people to do when I’m talking to them about things that impact me or offend me.”</p>\n<p>Omar’s most recent statement was interpreted more charitably by some left-leaning Jewish groups. The progressive organization J Street <a href=\"https://jstreet.org/press-releases/weaponization-and-oversimplification-of-israel-debate-must-end/#.XGHcQM9KhcC\">called</a> Monday’s controversy “overheated, ill-considered, and reductive,” arguing that the exchange “does nothing to advance the true interests and needs of Israelis or Palestinians, nor those of the American Jewish community. Lawmakers should be “extremely aware that tropes about Jewish money and political influence have been used for centuries to target and stigmatize” Jewish people, the group said in a statement, but they should “also refrain from labeling all criticism of Israeli actions or policies as ‘anti-Semitic,’ in a transparent effort to silence legitimate discussion and debate.” (Pelosi, for her part, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1095026564503343104\">said</a> she had met with Omar on Monday, and that both had come away “agree[ing] that we must use this moment to move forward as we reject anti-Semitism in all forms.”)</p>\n<p>But Omar’s slipups have given conservatives an opening to rip into the 37-year-old congresswoman, a staunch progressive ally of <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</strong> “Good that some Dems have condemned the disgraceful anti-Semitic remarks of Rep. Omar&#8212;but their words are empty unless Dem leaders remove her from the Foreign Affairs Committee,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveScalise/status/1095013990781079552\">wrote</a> Rep. <strong>Steve Scalise.</strong> “No one with her anti-Semitic views should be allowed to represent U.S. foreign policy.” In his initial threat to sanction Omar, McCarthy pointed to his own recent censure of Rep. <strong>Steve King</strong> after the Iowa congressman seemingly defended the terms “white nationalism [and] white supremacism.” “I think you’ve seen from my own actions that I take action about it,” McCarthy told reporters last Friday, despite being accused of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/28/politics/tom-steyer-mccarthy-tweet/index.html\">trafficking in anti-Semitic tropes himself</a>. “I think when they stay silent, they are just as guilty.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Congress","socialTitle":"A.O.C.

","familyName":"Bloomberg","bio":"For the majority of Americans, Michael Bloomberg will be known as the guy who tried to ban large sodas from New York City. But for the residents of New York, and the power brokers of the world, Bloomberg is a multi-disciplinary juggernaut, and perhaps the Rockefeller or Carnegie of the 21st century: a titan of finance, a media mogul, and the man who transformed the Big Apple during his unprecedented three terms as mayor. He’s also one of the top 10 wealthiest individuals in the world. As of 2016, according to <em>Forbes,</em> Bloomberg is worth $44.1 billion.\n<p>Raised in a middle-class family in Medford, Massachusetts, outside Boston, Bloomberg could have been content as a self-made billionaire, his fortune made from selling and curating real-time financial information on the Bloomberg terminal&#8212;the lifeblood of any Wall Street professional’s very existence. But in 2001, the lifelong Democrat became a Republican, poured $73 million of his own money into his campaign, won the endorsement of Rudy Giuliani, and became the mayor of New York City.</p>\n<p>Thus began Bloomberg’s controversial journey into public life, marked by extreme highs and lows. He advocated for the development of parks and bike lanes, banned smoking in restaurants, and implemented new food regulations to combat obesity. (One regulation attempted to ban large sodas more than 16 ounces, one of the many policies that led people to accuse him of turning the city into a nanny state.) During the 2008 economic crisis, he argued that he needed to have a third term to guide the finance-dependent city through the years of turbulence ahead. His exacting management style turned post-9/11 New York City, a town left for broke decades earlier, into essentially one of the world’s greatest businesses, a gleaming metropolis with plummeting crime rates, skyrocketing wealth, renewed real-estate development, and an ominous undercurrent of gentrification, the targeting of minority men with stop-and-frisk, and widening income inequality.</p>\n<p>Bloomberg has always been well meaning, even if his measures appear out of touch with reality: after he settled into a post-mayoral career of anti-gun activism and philanthropy, he had the urge to go back into public life, considering a run for president when the unpopular <strong>Donald Trump</strong> and <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> seemed to be the two candidates headed for the general election. But his trial balloon never quite took off. “I love our country too much to play a role in electing a candidate who would weaken our unity and darken our future&#8212;and so I will not enter the race for president of the United States,” he wrote on Bloomberg View, the opinion section of Bloomberg News, probably the most apt outlet in which he could have made the announcement.</p>","socialMedia":[],"photos":{"tout":[{"aspectRatios":{"3:2":{"width":1050,"height":700,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":103,"height":700,"width":1050}}},"5:3":{"width":1165,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":117,"width":1165,"height":699}}},"2:3":{"width":466,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":467,"width":466,"height":699}}},"16:9":{"width":1232,"height":693,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":84,"width":1232,"height":693}}},"4:3":{"width":932,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":234,"width":932,"height":699}}},"1:1":{"width":700,"height":700,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":350,"width":700,"height":700}}},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/24/5744ac62614dc9a45cb0adf8_hive-contributor-profile-mike-bloomberg.jpg","width":1400,"height":700}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 24, 2016 3:33 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-mike-bloomberg.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-mike-bloomberg.jpg","credit":"By Mark Wilson/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5744ac61c1f81aa45c811816","createdAt":"May 24, 2016 3:32 pm","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"May 24, 2016 3:33 pm","description":"Getty: 468907412","contributors":{}}]},"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","url":"/people/michael-bloomberg","mainPhotoContributors":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"aspectRatios":{"3:2":{"width":1050,"height":700,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":103,"height":700,"width":1050}}},"5:3":{"width":1165,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":117,"width":1165,"height":699}}},"2:3":{"width":466,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":467,"width":466,"height":699}}},"16:9":{"width":1232,"height":693,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":84,"width":1232,"height":693}}},"4:3":{"width":932,"height":699,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":234,"width":932,"height":699}}},"1:1":{"width":700,"height":700,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":350,"width":700,"height":700}}},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/05/24/5744ac62614dc9a45cb0adf8_hive-contributor-profile-mike-bloomberg.jpg","width":1400,"height":700}},"revisionCreatedAt":"May 24, 2016 3:33 pm","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","image":true},"revisionAuthor":"Jarondakie Patrick","filename":"hive-contributor-profile-mike-bloomberg.jpg","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[],"variantXsmall":[],"variantSmall":[],"variantMedium":[],"variantLarge":[],"variantXlarge":[],"_categories":{}},"title":"hive-contributor-profile-mike-bloomberg.jpg","credit":"By Mark Wilson/Getty Images.","_links":{},"id":"5744ac61c1f81aa45c811816","createdAt":"May 24, 2016 3:32 pm","revision":4,"modifiedAt":"May 24, 2016 3:33 pm","description":"Getty: 468907412","contributors":{}}}],"contributorsAuthor":[],"contributorsPhotographer":[],"publishHistory":{"entityId":"57362957ff97be4071973df5","revision":4,"pubDate":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","revisionAuthor":"Charles Truelson","searchable":true,"expired":false,"createdAt":"May 25, 2017 11:21 am","uri":"people/michael-bloomberg"},"_categories":{},"related":[{}]},"relatedItems":{"items":[{"hed":"Bloomberg Threatens to Drop $500 Million 2020 Carpet Bomb","promoHed":"Bloomberg Threatens to Drop $500 Million 2020 Carpet Bomb","dek":"The Democratic billionaire could transform the presidential race&#8212;whether he runs or not.","promoDek":"The Democratic billionaire could transform the presidential race&#8212;whether he runs or not.","body":"<p>With a net worth that hovers around <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-bloomberg/#480cb18c1417\">$50 billion</a>, <strong>Michael Bloomberg</strong> is by far the highest-rolling potential 2020 candidate, towering over President <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> and even self-declared person-of-means <strong>Howard Schultz.</strong> The former mayor hasn’t hesitated to throw his weight around, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/12/michael-bloomberg-100-million-2020-presidential-race\">hinting</a> that he might spend around $100 million to buy an advantage in the race, and shelling out donations to Democrats in the midterms. On Wednesday, however, Bloomberg upped the ante with a Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/13/michael-bloomberg-trump-2020-1167159\">report</a> that he would spend at <em>least</em> $500 million in 2020 to defeat Trump&#8212;whether or not he runs.</p>\n<p>Half a billion dollars is an ungodly amount by any metric. That’s roughly $175 million more than Trump spent in 2016, and outstrips the $129 million <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-reelection-effort-raised-21-million-in-the-fourth-quarter-campaign-says/2019/01/31/6e2a736a-2588-11e9-ad53-824486280311_story.html\">currently</a> sitting in the president’s re-election war chest. And that might just be the beginning: “[$500 million] will get us through the first few months,” Bloomberg adviser <strong>Kevin Sheekey</strong> told Politico. “Mike spent $100 million in his last New York City election. And you can do the math as you think more broadly but New York City is 3 percent of the national population.”</p>\n<p>As Democratic operatives briefed on Bloomberg’s operation told Politico, the billionaire philanthropist has earmarked said pile of money with two plans in mind. Plan A, obviously, is a presidential run as a Democrat. Plan B is bowing out of the race, but launching a massive parallel, data-driven campaign on behalf of the Democrats. According to internal polls, plan A could still pan out. “When people learn about his involvement in climate-change activism and gun safety, and when they learn that he’s not just a billionaire&#8212;but he came from a middle-class background and his dad never earned more than $6,000 a year, and you talk about the work he’s done on the ground and his philanthropy&#8212;Dem primary voters view him favorably,” said one Democrat familiar with the polling, adding that 80 percent of Democratic primary voters respond positively to Bloomberg’s biography.</p>\n<p>Still, the chances that Bloomberg wins the Democratic nomination are slim. His multi-year flirtation with running for president has never exactly caught the public’s imagination. Even now, after dropping $100 million on midterm races and continuing to fund gun-control efforts, Bloomberg is a dark horse: according to <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html#polls\">RealClearPolitics</a>, he polls an average 4.5 percent among Democratic candidates, with <strong>Joe Biden,</strong> his <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/indecision-2020-mike-bloombergs-presidential-dream-springs-eternal\">primary rival</a> for the centrist vote, field-stripping him by double digits. And that number is sure to fall as the field expands. In an election year in which Democrats are focused on identity politics and debating whether they should <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/opinion/abolish-billionaires-tax.html\">abolish billionaires</a> altogether, a 76-year-old white man with an eleven-figure net worth isn’t exactly a shoe-in.</p>\n<p>That leaves plan B, which seems carefully calculated to earn Bloomberg maximum goodwill. After promoting his favored policies in the Democratic primary&#8212;including strict gun-control measures&#8212;Bloomberg could easily pass his $500 million apparatus on to the nominee. That he’s publicizing plan B at all is an indication he’s eager to avoid the label of Schultz-style spoiler. “[His] priority No. 1 is Trump doesn’t get re-elected in 2020,” a Bloomberg insider <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/indecision-2020-mike-bloombergs-presidential-dream-springs-eternal\">told</a> my colleague <strong>Chris Smith</strong> earlier this month. “Obviously, who else is running is a part of that. What the polls say is a part of that. But I wouldn’t say there’s one thing he’s looking for to make his decision.” Ultimately, Bloomberg’s massive fortune gives him a layer of insulation: even if he drops out, he’ll earn bragging rights for launching a full-scale attack against the most unpopular president in the modern era.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting

More significantly, and tragically, it will also mark the one-year anniversary of the Parkland shooting, in which 17 Florida high-school students and staff members were murdered. It will also be <strong>Michael Bloomberg’s</strong> 77th birthday.</p>\n<p>The confluence of those last two events could make February 14 the perfect moment for Bloomberg to announce he is running for president, particularly because the tech billionaire and three-term New York City mayor has spent tens of millions of dollars of his own money fighting against the proliferation of guns. And his political team discussed the possibility of a February 14 announcement. One problem, though: Bloomberg still hasn’t made up his mind about whether he wants to become a candidate.</p>\n<p>This is the latest lap around the presidential-indecision track for Bloomberg. The biggest difference, so far, is that in 2008 and 2012, it was his Wall Street friends and political strategists pushing him to run. This time, Bloomberg himself initiated the exploration, in June 2018, in the wake of President <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> harsh crackdown on illegal immigration. Bloomberg’s enthusiasm hasn’t dimmed since then. Last fall, he reregistered as a Democrat, after equally pragmatic stretches as a Republican and as an independent, and he spent more than $100 million helping the party reclaim a House majority. To Bloomberg insiders, however, the strongest sign of his seriousness has been his ongoing willingness to travel and mix it up with rank-and-file voters. Bloomberg has visited obvious, high-profile early-primary states including Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, but he’s also made appearances at events in unglamorous Camden, New Jersey, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, ostensibly to hand out $2 million in grants for public arts projects, but also to take the Democratic temperature. “He’s felt pretty good coming out of these things,” a Bloomberg insider says. “But his priority No. 1 is Trump doesn’t get re-elected in 2020. Obviously, who else is running is a part of that. What the polls say is a part of that. But I wouldn’t say there’s one thing he’s looking for to make his decision.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, Bloomberg is trying to calculate two things: whether he can have more influence on the issues he cares about by spending his money or by running for office&#8212;and, if he runs, whether he has a viable shot at winning the Democratic nomination. The hostile reaction to <strong>Howard Schultz’s</strong> independent-bid trial balloon was viewed, in Bloomberg’s camp, as underscoring the Democratic determination to beat Trump, not as a rejection of billionaire businessman candidates. Bloomberg’s team has weighed how his chances might change with different timelines: on the one hand, Bloomberg, unlike conventional politicians, doesn’t need to raise money, so he can wait as long as he likes and see how the field develops. On the other, a later entry makes recruiting field staff harder, and allows a front-runner to gain momentum.</p>\n<p>Another significant factor is <strong>Joe Biden.</strong> Born nine months apart, Bloomberg and Biden have followed dramatically different paths to arrive at the same point, with money now playing an enormous, divergent role in their presidential campaign decisions. Biden, after some 40 years on the public payroll, is making real money for the first time in his life and providing well for his extended family; does he sacrifice that security after two unsuccessful presidential bids? Bloomberg, by contrast, has been fabulously wealthy for decades and could drop $500 million on a 50-state launch without flinching. A losing run would barely alter his bank account or his legacy.</p>\n<p>Having two older, white, male, moderate-ish contenders in the field would likely hurt them both. So Bloomberg and Biden have been doing a peculiar dance, keeping a close eye on one another while acting as if they don’t care what the other decides. The two men crossed paths on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, giving speeches at Reverend <strong>Al Sharpton’s</strong> commemoration in Washington, D.C.; neither mentioned their potential candidacy. Both have kept their outreach to potential Iowa field staff to a minimum, even as <strong>Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker,</strong> and other declared contenders rapidly stock their campaign teams. “We’ve got a really strong field already,“ says <strong>Norm Sterzenbach,</strong> the former executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party. “People are looking forward&#8212;we don’t need the savior, the elder statesman, to set us on the right course. Though Bloomberg would start in a good place, because competency is going to be a big argument, given the president we have now.”</p>\n<p>Last week, when a flurry of stories appeared detailing how Bloomberg, even if he didn’t run, would deploy his data operation to defeat Trump, a rival Democratic strategist interpreted it as a sign the Bloomberg team had picked up intelligence indicating Biden had decided to run. Bloomberg’s associates say they don’t have any inside knowledge of what Biden will do. And they don’t believe the former mayor is deferring to the former vice president, either intentionally or subconsciously, even though Biden’s decision would provide another highly valuable data point. “Mike still has an engineer’s brain,” one colleague says. Yet Bloomberg’s heart has been in this one far more than in previous flirtations&#8212;certainly because of his disgust with Trump, but also because that looming birthday is a stark reminder that if he doesn’t take a shot at the White House now, he never will.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The leaking, gossiping, and infighting that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-aide-recalls-conways-leaking-tactics-in-the-west-wing-vipers-nest?inline\">made Kellyanne Conway a formidable White House player</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Why old news habits must die&#8212;so that <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/how-the-media-can-prevent-2020-from-becoming-2016?inline\">real journalism can live</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Nancy Pelosi is America’s most powerful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-power-suits?inline\">power-suit boss</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Is Kamala Harris the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/kamala-harris-new-2020-democratic-frontrunner-oakland-speech?inline\">2020 candidate to beat?</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Your passport to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/behind-the-scenes-hollywood-cover-2019?inline\"><em>Vanity Fair</em>’s 25th Hollywood Issue</a> with Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Chadwick Boseman, and more</p>\n<p>Looking for more? <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/newsletters\">Sign up</a> for our daily Hive newsletter and never miss a story.</p>","rubric":"Politics","socialTitle":"Indecision 2020: Will Bloomberg’s Presidential Dreams End with Biden?","socialDescription":"Insiders say the billionaire dreams of crushing Trump, but is calculating whether he can win: “Mike still has an engineer’s brain.”","seoTitle":"Indecision 2020: Mike Bloomberg’s Presidential Dream Springs Eternal.

discrimination?","promoDek":"Isn’t criticizing the rich just anti-billionaire discrimination?","body":"<p>The past few weeks have been extremely tough on billionaires. Democratic lawmakers have <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/davos-billionaires-aoc-tax-proposal\">proposed</a> tax plans that could take them from “insanely, mind-bogglingly rich” to simply “absurdly rich.” One of their brethren announced he was seriously considering running for president in 2020, and instead of throwing him a parade and saying, “Thank god you got here when you did!”, people <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/mike-bloomberg-howard-schultz-2020\">told him</a> he was making a horrible mistake. A single individual was <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/finance/427674-historian-accuses-billionaires-at-davos-of-not-paying-their-fair-share-in\">mean to them at Davos</a>. Not one of them was invited to the State of the Union to highlight the epidemic of billionaire bullying. Obviously, this isn’t the sort of treatment billionaires signed up for when they entered the “fuck-ton of money” tax bracket, the contract for which specifically states they are to be exclusively praised and lionized for their wealth&#8212;a covenant that has been been violated in the most perverse of ways of late.  Luckily, a few brave souls&#8212;a kind of Freedom Riders, but for billionaires&#8212;are finally standing up and saying, enough. <em>The oppression must end.</em></p>\n<p>At Bloomberg, owned by billionaire <strong>Mike Bloomberg,</strong> columnist <strong>Tyler Cowen</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-02-07/stop-demeaning-billionaires-such-as-howard-schultz\">believes</a> we should stop demeaning billionaires by calling them billionaires, because in doing so we are “objectifying” them. It’s rude, he argued, to “casually describe individuals by their net wealth,” which is “often a preliminary step toward making others seem less human or less deserving of respect.” He went on:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I would hesitate, for example, before referring to someone publicly as “in the $150,000 range of net wealth,” even if most people knew that to be true. If I were a real-estate broker, I might talk about a customer this way, but it would be in a private context with another broker. Even then, calling someone “my $350,000 customer” or some such isn’t something that would endear me to Miss Manners.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You might feel it is different when a person’s net wealth is very high, such as when the word “billionaire” is deployed. But that distinction does not sit easy with me. If we use the word “billionaire” for this reason, then aren’t we also sending a negative message about the non-billionaires? At any rate, the people mocking <strong>[Howard] Schultz</strong> the most do not seem to be trying to give the word “billionaire” positive connotations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, one of the reasons people have been using the term “billionaire” derisively when describing the Starbucks C.E.O. is because they have an issue with the fact that the only reason he’d be able to get into the 2020 race (and likely give us <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-07/schultz-s-independent-bid-in-2020-would-help-trump-poll-finds\">another four years of <strong>Donald Trump</strong></a>) is because of his vast wealth. Another, perhaps, is that Schultz has come out against proposals like that of Rep. <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,</strong> with such declarations as, “I don’t think we want a 70 percent income tax in America.” That Schultz should be demonized for this, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/whos-afraid-of-howard-schultz-11548893911\">argues</a> <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>’s editorial board, is tantamount to treason:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Democrats might benefit from re-acquainting themselves with the private economy and wealth creation, which is damaged by punitive taxation. Mr. Schultz could point this out in debates and note how the success of Starbucks allowed him to provide thousands of Americans with jobs, good health care, and the $30 million to help veterans navigate the workforce that Mr. Schultz has written about in these pages.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Elsewhere in recent pleas to stop being so mean to the rich, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>’s <strong>Jason L. Riley,</strong> enraged that billionaire <strong>Ken Griffin’s</strong> purchase of the most expensive home in U.S. history received news coverage, bravely declared that “<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-a-billionaire-spends-his-money-is-his-own-business-11548807054\">how a billionaire spends his money is his own business</a>.” (In what we’re sure was an innocent omission, the article did not mention the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hedge-funds-got-bailout-bucks-too-2009-3\">$200 million</a> Griffin’s hedge fund received in taxpayer bailout funds during the financial crisis.) Meanwhile, the <em>Journal</em> also thinks it‘s the height of unfair that, if we’re going to allow “identity politics” to play a part in the next presidential election, one can “<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-love-diversity-except-when-it-comes-to-thought-11549411119\">identify as black</a>” but not as a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/grande-vs-keurig-billionaires-11548978810\">billionaire</a>, because it’s become such a dirty word.</p>\n<p>And yet, there may be hope. Perhaps, if the moniker is reclaimed to denote “genius, altruist, better than everyone else on earth,” things could change. It’ll take a lot of work&#8212;marches, demonstrations, brave souls who aren’t afraid to speak up&#8212;but it’ll be worth it, to tell our children we didn’t stand in silence.</p>\n<h3>More Great

climate change catastrophe.","body":"<p>When <strong>Sir Norman Foster</strong> was commissioned to design Bloomberg’s European headquarters, he was charged with balancing two ambitious objectives: aesthetic brilliance and environmental innovation. True to form, the multi-award-winning architect behind the Gherkin, the Millennium Bridge and the vast glass dome that frosts Germany’s Reichstag surpassed expectations. Rising above a restored Roman temple on a 3.2-acre site between Bank and St Paul’s, the 10-storey building was awarded the 2018 Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Prize. Fitted with bronze lung-like blades that work as natural ventilators, smart airflow controls, and a water conservation system that saves 25 million litres of water each year (enough to fill 10 Olympic swimming pools), it has also been named the most sustainable office in the world. “It has not just raised the bar for office design and city planning, but smashed the ceiling,” said RIBA president, <strong>Ben Derbyshire</strong>, when describing the “once-in-a-generation project”.</p>\n<p>With its ceiling-smashing credentials, Bloomberg HQ was the natural space to host the inaugural Bloomberg <em>Vanity Fair</em> Climate Exchange, which took place on December 11 and 12, 2018, closing a febrile year of environmental advance, tumult, hope and despair. In October, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a landmark report warning that we have just 12 years to avert catastrophe by working to limit global warming to a maximum of 1.5°C. A mere half-degree rise beyond this level, they wrote, will significantly aggravate the risk of droughts, floods, extreme temperatures and acute poverty for large swathes of the world’s population. The report was commissioned at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakech in 2016. Since then, the chasm between politics and environmental science has deepened. Leading the charge, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, and cast climate change research as a partisan, anti-business ill. Similarly, Brazil’s new president <strong>Jair Bolsonaro</strong> has dismissed environmental protections, and removed Brazil from the list of potential hosts for the UN’s upcoming climate conference.</p>\n<p>As some lawmakers negate their responsibility to safeguard the environment, and others remain too divided to conceive and implement pioneering legislation, the Exchange was an opportunity to gather a network of leading figures, outline the shared, systemic problems threatening every industry, and also offer a panoramic insight into the work of the groups and individuals who are enacting change.</p>\n<p>The opening of the Exchange was marked with a glittering Gala dinner. Arriving outside Bloomberg HQ (thought to be the largest stone building built in the City of London since St Paul’s Cathedral), guests were confronted with Danish-Icelandic artist <strong>Olafur Eliasson</strong>’s installation, Ice Watch. Six enormous hulks of blue-hued, slowly melting hunks of glacial ice extracted from the waters surrounding Greenland, the sculptures were intended to serve as a visual reminder of the impact of climate change. Moving inside, and into a line of futuristic transparent lifts, guests arrived at the office’s large atrium area, which is dominated by a bronze ramp called the Vortex that spans six desk-filled floors, winding towards a glazed rooflight.</p>\n<p>As the crowd swelled to include <strong>Tracey Emin</strong>, <strong>Rod Stewart</strong>, <strong>Tom Daley</strong>, <strong>Gizzi Erskine</strong>, <strong>Yana Peel</strong> and <strong>Paloma Faith</strong>, the model, activist and actress <strong>Lily Cole</strong>&#8212;wearing a <strong>Christopher Raeburn</strong> two-piece fashioned from 1950s Royal Air Force silk maps&#8212;took a break from the drinks reception and made her way to <em>Vanity Fair</em>’s signature portrait studio, where photographer <strong>Matt Holyoak</strong> was busily shooting guests spanning politics, business, fashion and the arts. She was soon followed by a stream of stars, including <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> actress <strong>Victoria Loke</strong>, actor <strong>Rob Lowe</strong>, and <strong>Stella McCartney</strong>, whose date for the evening was model <strong>Arizona Muse</strong>. Sitting down for dinner at two long, flower-laden tables, guests were soon treated to  a surprise appearance from <strong>Ellie Goulding</strong> who, after belting out a roster of hits, sat for her own portrait.</p>\n<p>The following day was introduced by <em>Vanity Fair</em> editor <strong>Radhika Jones</strong> and <strong>Michael R. Bloomberg</strong>, who was appointed UN Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change in 2014, and has consistently advocated for the US to move towards clean energy. Primarily operating through Bloomberg Philanthropies, he has invested millions of dollars into sustainability, often working at a municipal level to avoid becoming embroiled in America’s choked federal system.</p>\n<p>The first act focused on business and culture, and was opened by London Mayor <strong>Sadiq Khan</strong>, whose theme was the relation between cities and climate-friendly business. “In the absence of national leadership, it’s cities, business and civil society that can and must step into the breach to ensure we honour the Paris Agreement,” said Khan, echoing comments that Bloomberg himself made when speaking to <em>Vanity Fair</em> in December: “Cities are where people are, and they’re where the carbon emissions are. So if you get cities to do the right thing, you can make an awful lot of progress.”</p>\n<p>Next up was a conversation between <strong>Christiane Amanpour</strong>, CNN’s chief international anchor, and designer Stella McCartney, exploring the ways that the fashion industry can help curb climate change. A champion of sustainable practices long before they became trendy (the fashion industry contributes 10 per cent of global greenhouse emissions), McCartney even sourced animal-friendly shoes in her Central Saint Martins graduate fashion show (these were overshadowed by the fact they were modelled by her friends <strong>Kate Moss</strong> and <strong>Naomi Campbell</strong>). Later, setting up her eponymous label after a successful stint at Chloé, McCartney set herself ambitious sustainability targets and advocated animal welfare, ultimately stirring a movement that has since swelled and inspired other luxury brands to follow suit: Gucci, Armani, Versace and Burberry have all shunned fur. “Because the fashion industry has a significant impact on the environment, there is an enormous opportunity for consequential change,” McCartney explained to Amanpour, stressing the business case for sustainable fashion, and expanding on the recent UN fashion industry charter for climate action. “Ultimately, it’s the smart decision for the planet and for our industry.”</p>\n<p>After performances from a selection of spoken-word poets, the curtain lifted on the second act: oceans. Moderated by <strong>Ian Urbina</strong>, the investigative reporter for <em>The New York Times</em>, who has reported on Pulitzer Prize-winning stories and whose articles are regularly adapted into films, the panel talk focused on the positive impact of conserving coral and protecting oceans from overfishing. <strong>Baroness Patricia Scotland QC</strong>, secretary-general of the Commonwealth, dialled in via video link to join <strong>Tony Long</strong>, CEO of Global Fishing Watch, and chairman <strong>Anisa Kamadoli Costa</strong>, who spearheads Tiffany &amp; Co’s sustainability efforts. These began in earnest when the iconic jewellery maker made the unprecedented move of removing coral&#8212;often called the nursery of the oceans&#8212;from their products. “We have a real responsibility&#8212;and opportunity&#8212;to set the trend for what sustainable luxury means in the jewellery industry,” said Kamadoli Costa, who holds the dual title of president of the Tiffany &amp; Co Foundation and chief sustainability officer, in an interview with VF before the Exchange. “Sustainable luxury is quality and craftsmanship, but also the environmental and social standards that we choose to uphold. We have the power and privilege of using the Tiffany brand to make an impact. I don’t think now is the time to stay silent.”</p>\n<p>The third act was energy, and saw <strong>Mayor William Peduto</strong> of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania&#8212;the “Paris of Appalachia”&#8212;discuss the challenges of transitioning off coal and its impacts on public health, and the urgency of local leadership in the fight against climate change. “Cities and citizens have an important role to play in the fight against climate change,” said Mayor Peduto, who expressed his frustration at Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in the documentary Paris to Pittsburgh, which looks at the city’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions. “I was proud to represent my city at the COP [United Nations Conference of Parties] in Poland and again here in London as we continue to find ways to unite the various actors in this critical time.”</p>\n<p>Coinciding with the third anniversary of the signing of the Paris Agreement, the Exchange aimed to galvanise progress ahead of the upcoming UN Climate Change Summit, which promises to be a fraught, urgent affair. But the focus wasn’t just negative. The Exchange also celebrated the progress being made across multiple spheres, spotlighting the creativity and entrepreneurial acuity being channelled towards safeguarding the natural world, restructuring the cities we live in and empowering individuals to enact change. “Climate change has proven to be both a short- and long-term threat with this year demonstrating some of the worst impacts on citizens worldwide,” said Michael R. Bloomberg. “Following on from world leaders gathering in Poland to discuss the issue, the Climate Exchange has highlighted the human impact and solutions.”</p>","rubric":"From the

running for president, from one billionaire to another.","body":"<p>In an interview with <em>The New York Times</em> published on Sunday, <strong>Howard Schultz</strong>, who unleashed Pumpkin Spice Lattes on the masses, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/us/politics/howard-schultz-president-2020.html\">confirmed</a> what many have long suspected: he firmly believes the 2020 presidential race could use another billionaire candidate who hasn’t so much as served as a congressional intern, and he’s <em>this close</em> to announcing that he is that very billionaire, having “already begun the groundwork required to be on the ballot in all 50 states” as an independent. (Schultz will reportedly spend the next three months traveling the country&#8212;perhaps, say, to Iowa&#8212;before making an official announcement.) Unsurprisingly, the news raised the hackles of fellow billionaire <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> who took time out of his busy day of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1089883338758914048\">attacking</a> the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1089691564283183105\">media</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1089876055224184833\">arguing against the separation of church and state</a> to claim that Schultz has neither the brains nor the balls to run for office:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1089881244312178688\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1089881244312178688\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1089881244312178688</a></p></blockquote></div><p>But Trump wasn’t the only member of the three-comma club to come out against Schultz’s (kind-of) candidacy. On Monday afternoon, <strong>Mike Bloomberg</strong> issued a statement on his Web site saying that <a href=\"https://www.mikebloomberg.com/news/mike-bloomberg-statement-independent-run/\">the notion of running as an independent is a horrible idea</a>, and one that will almost certainly put Trump back in the White House for a second term. “I have never been a partisan guy,” the former New York City mayor wrote, “and it’s no secret that I looked at an independent bid in the past. In fact, I faced exactly the same decision now facing others who are considering it. The data was very clear and very consistent. Given the strong pull of partisanship and the realities of the electoral college system, there is no way an independent can win. That is truer today than ever before. In 2020, the great likelihood is that an independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the president. That’s a risk I refused to run in 2016 and we can’t afford to run it now.”</p>\n<p>To some, the idea of Bloomberg warning Schultz off an independent bid is the height of rich, even if he’s clearly 100 percent right. But as the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-bloomberg/#59bf86d61417\">$48 Billion Dollar Man</a> himself points out, he’s been studying up on how to lose elections for <em>years,</em> and after considering independent runs in 2008, 2012, and 2016, he has the data to say definitively it should never be attempted, particularly when it raises the chances of giving an unhinged lunatic another four years in the White House. That’s not to say Bloomberg has an issue with putting another, richer billionaire in office through the two-party system:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With an estimated net worth of $3.3 billion, Mr. Schultz, 65, is one of several billionaires who had been mentioned as possible presidential contenders. The former hedge-fund titan <strong>Tom Steyer,</strong> who had been eyeing a run, announced this month he would focus his energies on a private effort to impeach Mr. Trump. And Mr. Bloomberg has also been contemplating a presidential run.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That’s a prospect that has Wall Street licking its lips, even if financiers know, deep down inside, that the idea of President Bloomberg is little more than an extremely niche fantasy. “I’m a socially liberal, fiscally conservative centrist who would love to vote for a rational Democrat and get Trump out of the White House,” an anonymous C.E.O. of one of the nation’s largest banks <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/28/wall-street-2020-economy-taxes-1118065\">told</a> Politico’s <strong>Ben White.</strong> “Personally, I’d love to see Bloomberg run and get the nomination. I’ve just never thought he could get the nomination the way the primary process works.”</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Schultz’s listening-tour is off to a great start</strong></p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/alexis_levinson/status/1090039389495939072\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexis_levinson/status/1090039389495939072\">https://twitter.com/alexis_levinson/status/1090039389495939072</a></p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Speaking of Wall Street’s hopes and fears for 2020</strong></p>\n<p>It should surprise virtually no one to hear that two words <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-warren-eyes-white-house-big-banks-brace-for-browbeating-11548671401\">are keeping the industry up at night</a>: <strong>Elizabeth Warren:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Warren’s presidential bid will be driven by her populist assault on big banks that helped her rise to prominence during the financial crisis and in her successful 2012 Massachusetts Senate race.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Although the economy has recovered and new, stricter regulations remain largely in place, Ms. Warren sees cause for further vigilance, and many on Wall Street dread another round of criticism on an even bigger national stage&#8212;the Democratic presidential primary race.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“She has this sort of applause line that we are all crooks, which is scary that you may hear that for a year and a half,” said a large U.S. bank executive who asked to remain anonymous for fear of a Warren backlash.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Still, at least some on Wall Street understand that a president who might nominate regulators who actually hold the industry accountable or insist on stricter oversight of the people that brought you <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/elizabeth-warren-eviscerates-equifax-for-profiting-off-screw-up\">the Equifax hack</a>, is <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/28/wall-street-2020-economy-taxes-1118065\">preferable</a> to an unpredictable lunatic who drags the country into self-defeating trade wars and shuts the government down because someone forgot to feed him his Big Macs and his blood sugar plummeted.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Among the most hardcore Democrats on Wall Street, the strong desire is to find a candidate&#8212;any candidate&#8212;who can beat Trump, even if that means getting behind someone like Warren who supports policies that bankers hate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“Everybody just wants to win,” a senior executive told Politico. “It’s as wide open as I’ve ever seen it. There is no gravitational force that everyone is sort of running towards. Everyone has their candidate. Frankly, if people believed Warren would win, they’d jump on board. And everyone in the top tier not named Bernie Sanders could probably win.”</p>\n<p><strong>Wall Street’s #MeToo takeaway: avoid women women like the plague</strong></p>\n<p>“I now think twice about spending one-on-one time with a young female colleague,” a U.S. finance executive <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/world/europe/metoo-backlash-gender-equality-davos-men.html\">confessed</a> to <em>The New York Times</em> on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, requesting anonymity because the issue is “just too sensitive.” Apparently worried they might accidentally sexually harass someone, “a number of men have [said] that they will avoid going to dinner with a female mentee,” and that they’re “concerned about deploying a woman solo on-site with a male,” <strong>Pat Milligan,</strong> who advises multi-national companies on gender and diversity issues, told reporter <strong>Katrin Bennhold.</strong> Men who don’t know how to behave around women in a way that couldn’t be construed as harassment: the true victims of #MeToo!</p>\n<p><strong>A.O.C. puts big tech on notice</strong></p>\n<p>In a letter co-signed by Representative <strong>Chellie Pingree,</strong> the freshman congresswoman told Facebook, Microsoft, and Google that she was “deeply disappointed” to learn that the companies “were high-level sponsors of a conference this month . . . known as LibertyCon, that included a session denying established science on climate change.” Noting that the corporations have pledged to reduce their carbon footprints and committed to pursuing renewable energy, the lawmakers said that such efforts were undercut by “implicit support of the session organized at LibertyCon.” Likening today’s “coordinated campaign to deny climate change, or to put a positive spin on its effects” as “not unlike that of the tobacco companies which once sought to discredit their product’s link to cancer,” Ocasio-Cortez and Pingree said the tech giants must ensure that such climate-change propaganda “do not reflect the values of your companies going forward,“ whether intentional or otherwise.</p>\n<p><strong>What Trump’s shutdown hath wrought</strong></p>\n<p>A day after president and his chief of staff <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-is-already-threatening-a-second-shutdown\">threatened</a> to shut down the government for a second time come February 15, the Congressional Budget Office <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/28/government-shutdown-cost-1123735\">reported</a> that the 35-day temper tantrum cost the U.S. economy roughly $3 billion in lost economic activity that “will not be recouped.” Meanwhile, federal contractors, who will not receive back pay for five weeks of lost wages, will have to wait another month until receiving a full paycheck, because their companies will have to wait to be paid by the government. (“It feels like we are still hostages,” <strong>Janice Morgan,</strong> who also had her insurance cut off during the shutdown, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/it-feels-like-we-are-still-hostages-federal-contractors-who-lost-health-insurance-during-shutdown-remain-in-limbo/2019/01/27/9a1020a2-20c3-11e9-9145-3f74070bbdb9_story.html\">told</a> <em>The Washington Post.</em>) And how ‘bout <a href=\"https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2019/01/26/joshua-tree-national-park-rally-against-shutdown-impact/2689866002/\">those national parks</a>?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The federal government shutdown may be over, but fans of Joshua Tree National Park are still angry and upset about the furlough that kept park rangers off the job. . . . Park gates remained open during the shutdown as vandals cut down several Joshua trees and damaged rocks. Without park maintenance crews for the first three weeks, volunteers stepped up to clean bathrooms and collect trash. <strong>Curt Sauer,</strong> who retired as Joshua Tree National Park superintendent in 2010, praised the work of volunteers and lamented the damage caused to the park from illegal campfires, camping and vehicle travel. “What’s happened to our park in the last 34 days is irreparable for the next 200 to 300 years,” he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Remember Gary Cohn asked C.E.O.s to raise their hands if they were going to spend their tax-cut savings on investments no one did?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/1-5-trillion-tax-cut-had-no-major-impact-business-n963411\">Turns out they weren’t kidding</a>!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Trump administration’s $1.5 trillion tax cut package appeared to have no major impact on businesses’ capital investment or hiring plans, according to a survey released a year after the biggest overhaul of the tax code in more than 30 years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The National Association of Business Economics’ quarterly business conditions poll, published on Monday, found that while some companies reported accelerating investments because of lower corporate taxes, 84 percent of respondents said they had not changed plans. That compares to 81 percent in the previous survey published in October.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“A large majority of respondents, 84 percent, indicate that one year after its passage, the corporate tax reform has not caused their firms to change hiring or investment plans,” said NABE president <strong>Kevin Swift.</strong> As a reminder, the White House’s big argument for the tax bill was that it would lead to an investment boom, with companies showering workers with their billions in tax savings.</p>\n<p><strong>Elsewhere!</strong></p>\n<p>Treasury Set to Borrow $1 Trillion for a Second Year to Finance the Deficit (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-28/another-year-another-1-trillion-in-new-debt-for-u-s-to-raise\">Bloomberg</a>)</p>\n<p>Bridgewater, RenTech Make $13 Billion in a Grim Year for Hedge Funds (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-28/bridgewater-rentech-make-13-billion-in-a-grim-hedge-fund-year\">Bloomberg</a>)</p>\n<p>“Another frustration with manufacturing in Texas: American workers won’t work around the clock.

Despite the lawsuit, the premium cabler still plans to air the film in its entirety.","body":"<p>The Michael Jackson-focused documentary <em>Leaving Neverland</em> has already caused a mountain of controversy, even before its official debut. The film reportedly attracted <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/01/michael-jackson-leaving-neverland-sundance-film-festival-police-concerns-protests-threats-1202538783/\">direct threats</a> ahead of its Sundance Film Festival screening last month&#8212;and now the Jackson estate is suing HBO for planning to air the doc in the first place, saying that the network has violated an alleged non-disparagement clause from 1992.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/michael-jackson-leaving-neverland-hbo-suit-1203145085/\"><em>Variety</em></a>, the suit claims HBO entered into an agreement in 1992 to air <em>Michael Jackson in Concert in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour</em>&#8212;a pact that included a non-disparagement agreement. A <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/02/finding-neverland-lawsuit-michael-jackson-estate-sues-hbo-1202562002/\">copy</a> of the suit published by Deadline estimates that damages could exceed $100 million.</p>\n<p>“As you must know, contrary to all norms of documentary filmmaking, the Estate was never contacted by the supposed ‘documentarian,’ <strong>Dan Reed</strong> (or anyone else associated with the program) to provide the Estate’s views on, and responses to, the absolutely false claims that are the subject matter of the program,” the suit <a href=\"https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/mj-arbitration-doc-1.pdf\">states</a>. “Likewise, no one else who might offer evidence to contradict the program’s premise was consulted either, as Dan Reed has publicly admitted.”</p>\n<p>The suit alleges that the accusations from both of the Jackson accusers interviewed in the doc, <strong>Wade Robson</strong> and <strong>James Safechuck,</strong> are financially motivated. The suit also noted that both Robson and Safechuck initially defended Jackson, denying that they had been abused as children&#8212;a fact that the doc acknowledges, and both men explain extensively. “They previously testified that Jackson never touched them inappropriately in any manner whatsoever,” the lawsuit states. “By 2013 and 2014, they were in financial dire straits . . . So, in 2013 and 2014, Robson and Safechuck changed their stories. No doubt reading reports from <em>Forbes</em> and others, and seeing programs like <em>60 Minutes</em> that reported on the unprecedented success of the Jackson Estate&#8212;stories that all ran in the year before these men changed their stories&#8212;Robson and Safechuck filed suits against the Jackson Estate.”</p>\n<p>In Robson’s case, the suit claims the choreographer was having trouble securing work&#8212;and that the Jackson Estate had passed him over for the lead choreography job in a Cirque du Soleil show. Robson addressed that notion during an <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/michael-jackson-accusers-explain-speaking-out-hbo-leaving-neverland\">interview</a> with <em>V.F.</em>’s <strong>Nicole Sperling.</strong> “I was hired three times for that show because it kept taking different iterations,” Robson said. “And the third time was just preceding my second nervous breakdown. I was in between nervous breakdowns. So the third time, as I was crumbling and falling apart, I removed myself from the project. The accusation is completely false.”</p>\n<p>In a statement to <em>Variety,</em> Jackson family estate attorney <strong>Howard Weitzman</strong> said, “HBO and the director were well aware of their financial motives and that ample opposing facts are available from numerous sources, but made the unconscionable decision to bury any evidence casting doubt on their chosen narrative. Had they made an objective film it would have allowed viewers to make up their own minds about these allegations, instead of having a television network dictate to them that they must accept these false claims about Michael Jackson.”</p>\n<p>In its own statement, HBO told <em>Variety,</em> “Despite the desperate lengths taken to undermine the film, our plans remain unchanged. HBO will move forward with the airing of <em>Leaving Neverland,</em> the two-part documentary, on March 3 and 4. This will allow everyone the opportunity to assess the film and the claims in it for themselves.”</p>","rubric":"","socialTitle":"Michael Jackson Estate Sues HBO for $100 Million Over Leaving Neverland","socialDescription":"The documentary focuses on two men who have accused Jackson of molesting them as children.

camp.","body":"<p>The estate of Michael Jackson has taken another step to formally push back against the upcoming documentary <em>Leaving Neverland,</em> which focuses on pedophilia allegations made against the late entertainer. Estate attorney <strong>Howard Weitzman</strong> sent a letter to Channel 4, the U.K. network that is set to air the film in early March. In the letter, Weitzman claims the <em>Leaving Neverland</em> filmmakers never attempted to reach out to the Jackson estate, nor did they reach out to family, friends, and other defenders of Jackson, falling short of the network’s <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/producers-handbook/c4-guidelines/factual-programme-guidelines\">ethical guidelines</a>.</p>\n<p>“Those concerned should be given an appropriate and timely opportunity to respond,” the letter reads, per the <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/20a6870958754ec5978935d4bc06451e\">Associated Press</a>. “I think we can all agree that the false allegations being made in your ‘documentary’ are ‘significant allegations’ . . . it is hard to imagine more significant accusations that can possibly be made against anyone.”</p>\n<p>The estate also sent a letter to HBO, which will air the film in the U.S., calling the Jackson accusers “disgraceful” and saying their backgrounds should be examined, per the A.P.</p>\n<p>Channel 4 has responded by noting that Jackson’s past denials of the allegations are included in the film, which is enough to meet the network’s standards. “On this occasion the person against whom the significant allegations are being made is deceased. It is therefore appropriate that his denials during life are included in the program,” the station said, according to the A.P. Jackson died in 2009.</p>\n<p><em>Leaving Neverland</em> director <strong>Dan Reed</strong> has also responded to the estate, noting that the focus of the film is on the two accusers, <strong>Wade Robson</strong> and <strong>James Safechuck,</strong> both of whom have said that Jackson molested them when they were children. In the past, both accusers explicitly told authorities that the singer did not molest them; Robson also testified at Jackson’s 2005 trial. Jackson denied the allegations and was not convicted. “Anyone who sees the film will know it is solely about hearing the stories of two specific individuals and their families in their own words, and that is a focus we are very proud of,” Reed said.</p>\n<p><em>Leaving Neverland</em> made its debut in January at the Sundance Film Festival, where <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/michael-jackson-documentary-leaving-neverland-stuns-at-sundance\">it stunned critics</a> and sparked backlash from Jackson’s most ardent fans. Robson and Safechuck attended the debut screening, sitting down for a Q&amp;A afterward. “We are just trying to tell the story, to shine light on it,” Safechuck said. “The same way&#8212;knowing Wade went through this&#8212;we can give other people the connection and comfort that we’ve received.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; The <a

documentary.","body":"<p><strong>Wade Robson</strong> didn’t dance for five years. <strong>James Safechuck</strong> can’t listen to a Michael Jackson song without being gripped by anxiety. Both men, fathers of young children, expressed fear over their sons turning the ages of 7 and 10. These were the ages Robson, now 36, and Safechuck, now 40, were, respectively, when they allege Jackson began sexually molesting them.</p>\n<p>The two men are the subjects of <strong>Dan Reed’s</strong> upcoming documentary <em>Leaving Neverland,</em> which will debut on HBO on March 3 after <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/michael-jackson-documentary-leaving-neverland-stuns-at-sundance\">having its world premiere</a> at the Sundance Film Festival in January. The documentary provides detailed accounts of the allegations first brought forth by Robson and Safechuck <a href=\"https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2014/08/michael-jackson-wade-robson-sexual-assault-anal/\">in 2013</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/exclusive-michael-jackson-hit-with-new-sex-abuse-claim\">2014</a>, in lawsuits against the Jackson estate that were eventually dismissed due to statutes of limitations. In addition to providing detailed accusations of both sexual activity and repeated efforts by Jackson to quiet the boys, <em>Leaving Neverland</em> showcases the effect the late pop star had on Robson and Safechuck’s families, with detailed interviews with the men’s mothers, wives, and siblings.</p>\n<p>In 1993, Jackson was accused of molesting 13-year-old Jordan Chandler. The case ended after Jackson reached a civil settlement with the Chandler family for <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/06/16/michael.jackson/\">$20 million</a>. In 2003, an arrest warrant was issued and Jackson was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/12/18/jackson.case/\">charged</a> with seven counts of child molestation and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent for the purpose of committing a felony. He was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/13/national/michael-jackson-is-acquitted-on-all-counts-in-molestation-case.html\">acquitted in 2005</a> of all charges. In a 2003 British documentary, Jackson admitted to sharing his bed with young boys but called it a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/14/us/michael-jackson-cleared-after-14week-child-molesting-trial.html\">loving act</a> that had nothing to do with sex.</p>\n<p>Jackson denied all charges. He was aided in his defense by both Robson and Safechuck. Robson testified on Jackson’s behalf during both trials while Safechuck declined to provide testimony in the second trial, a move that Safechuck says angered Jackson and ended his relationship with the pop star. The about-face by the two victims is investigated thoroughly in the film and Robson elaborated on it further. “There was no repressed memory. I never forgot any of it,” he said. “A lot of what was going on when I was 11, was the direct fear that Michael put into me that if anybody was to find out about this, both of us would go to jail for the rest of our lives. I absolutely believed that. I was terrified of that. And I was terrified for Michael. I loved Michael and I was trying to save him. So many things were going on at the same time: fear, shame, confusion, and love. I knew I was telling a lie but I knew I had to. I felt like I had no choice.”</p>\n<p>Since the two-part, four-hour documentary was first announced it’s been the subject of controversy. The extended Jackson family and their die-hard supporters have waged attacks on the film, its subjects, and journalists covering the movie. <strong>Howard Weitzman,</strong> an attorney for Jackson’s estate, called the film disgraceful <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/michael-jackson-estate-leaving-neverland-letter-channel-4\">in a 10-page letter to HBO</a>, adding “We know that this will go down as the most shameful episode in HBO’s history. We know that Michael’s devoted fans, and all good people in the world, will not swiftly forgive HBO for its conduct.”</p>\n<p>The filmmakers and subjects of the film expected such uproar. The embrace they received from their Sundance audience proved more surprising. “Getting public support is not something we are used to,” said Safechuck, during an interview in Park City, Utah, the day after the film’s premiere last month. “We are not used to people believing us. My mother believes me&#8212;I’m used to that&#8212;but I’m not used to other people believing me.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/56a2690cff2afb2567000010.js?autoplay=0\"></div></div><p>Robson and Safechuck first met Reed in 2016 when the director approached them with interest in telling their story. Reed, a British documentarian <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/19/arts/television/19hbo.html\">best known for his work covering the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack</a>, had no real interest in Jackson or show business. He wasn’t even very familiar with any of his songs. Rather, Reed was compelled by the opportunity to be inside the story, to take a closer look at the controversies that dogged Jackson since his first accuser, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1994/01/orth199401\">Chandler, came forward in 1993</a>.</p>\n<p>“I would not have done this story if it hadn’t been for these guys,” said Reed, sitting at a conference table with Robson and Safechuck. “This is a chance to reveal something true and extraordinary about a story we think we all know. . . . It’s very rare that you get that incredible turning of the tables, the inside of a huge story, one that’s never been resolved yet is one that everyone knows about.”</p>\n<p>Reed spent two days interviewing Safechuck and three speaking with Robson. He also said he needed to take a step back and talk to the family members to understand how their mothers, specifically, could have let their young sons sleep in Jackson’s bed, spend weekends at his Neverland Ranch, and put so much trust into a man with such strange proclivities. Both men confirmed that they weren’t paid for their time or their stories. Rather, they say they were compelled to participate in order to get the truth out. And they did so before the #MeToo movement gave people with allegations of sexual abuse an opportunity for a fairer hearing. Below are edited excerpts from our interview.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Vanity Fair:</em> Is it possible for you two to describe what it was like watching this film with an audience full of strangers?</strong></p>\n<p><em>James Safechuck:</em> I think it will take a few more watches because the first [time] is kind of a shock. You’re watching a movie with you in it. That in itself is hard to . . . get. It was difficult for me to read the audience. I didn’t know if they were connecting to certain parts or not. It might have been obvious to other people, but for me, it was just a lot of nerves and disassociation.</p>\n<p><strong>Haven’t you both mastered the art of disassociation?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Safechuck:</em> Yeah, right. I said to Wade yesterday that I don’t want to switch off. The survival mechanism of switching off is something we are used to doing. And it’s easy to default to that. And I do not want to do that. I want to go there and stay in the moment and try and feel it.</p>\n<p><em>Wade Robson:</em> In other places, whether its been in the legal proceedings or even talking to friends about this subject matter, it tends to be narrowly focused on what happened between Michael and me. And what the film goes into is the entire effect on our whole families. We had no part in the interviews with our families and they revealed so many feelings that I never knew about me, about our family. Hearing their perspectives keeps re-clarifying the breadth of what this has done to our family. The weight of that keeps hitting at a harder and harder level.</p>\n<p><strong>Dan, you said that you had other interviews and you had a wider scope but you pared the film down to just the families. Now that’s being used against you by the estate and his fans that you are only telling one side of the story. What do you say to that?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Dan Reed:</em> What is the other side of the story? That Michael Jackson was a great entertainer and a great guy? That may be true but he also raped children.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t that I didn’t want to represent the other side, the other side being Jackson and his lawyers and the people who don’t believe he was a serial child molester. Jackson and his lawyers and the people who attack these guys are represented in the film. We have Jackson’s dad saying this is awful and terrible and they are liars&#8212;I’m talking about the other children who brought complaints of their own. And his lawyers say these are a pack of lies.</p>\n<p>But I found Wade and James’s accounts so persuasive and internally consistent and credible that I thought it wasn’t worth breaking the storytelling perspective completely to introduce extraneous people who didn’t have the kind of intimate access to Jackson, who weren’t part of that world that he created around the kids and the abuse. I think there is a divide between people who’ve seen the film and totally get it&#8212;I don’t think there was a single person in the cinema yesterday who didn’t get what we were doing&#8212;and the people who haven’t seen it and are saying but, but.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1994/01/orth19940\">Plus: Read Maureen Orth’s Groundbreaking 1994 Investigation</a></h4>\n<p>We also did fact-checks and we looked for whatever corroboration we could find. The central facts they reveal are the facts of the abuse. And we had the conversations that they had to describe the sex in some detail. We couldn’t skirt around that. It would leave a space for the naysayers, for the people whose interest is in discrediting James and Wade [to suggest] it was just affection, just cuddles, it was harmless. No, it was grown-up sexual activity except it was with little children.</p>\n<p><strong>The allegations of abuse are terribly upsetting, made even more so by the fact that both of your accounts were so similar.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Robson:</em> That’s been one of the craziest experiences for me. James and I haven’t been able to be together or talk to each other, and while I had an expectation, at least with the sexual details, that they would probably be relatively similar, in seeing the film, [I was surprised] to the degree that they were. Beyond the sexual abuse and activity, [I was also surprised] by our symptoms, the details of our lives, us becoming fathers. It’s been mind-blowing to learn each other’s stories.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the extent of communication you two had before meeting here in Sundance?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Safechuck:</em> We were in one meeting together with our lawyers, supervised.</p>\n<p><em>Robson:</em> One meeting years and years ago.</p>\n<p><strong>Didn’t you want to just pick up the phone and talk to each other?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Safechuck:</em> What brought me into the case was wanting to talk to Wade. And then as soon as I get there, they say, great but you can’t talk to him. That was really tough.</p>\n<p><em>Robson:</em> It’s been this feeling through this time of not being able to communicate but having some sort of knowingness that even though technically we don’t, we know each other deeper than we know most other people in our lives because of what we’ve been through. I just wanted to be able to connect about that and validate each other’s experiences, mostly the experiences post abuse: the effects, the struggles, to share that with some who, instinctually, is going to understand.</p>\n<p><em>Safechuck:</em> I would just hold on to knowing that Wade is out there. There was comfort in knowing that I wasn’t alone. It also made decisions about doing this movie difficult. We couldn’t [decide together] “should we do it.” We had to make these decisions independently. What do we want? We want the truth. We want to be heard. Is this the right thing to do? Those were hard decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Wade, one of the accusations against you is that you filed your lawsuit because you were broke after they fired you from the Jackson Cirque du Soleil show?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Robson:</em> It’s just completely inaccurate. I was hired three times for that show because it kept taking different iterations. And the third time was just preceding my second nervous breakdown. I was in between nervous breakdowns. So the third time, as I was crumbling and falling apart, I removed myself from the project. The accusation is completely false.</p>\n<p><strong>Dan, did you reach out to Macaulay Culkin for this piece?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Reed:</em> No, we did not. Macaulay has gone on the record many, many times, including recently to say that his relationship with Jackson was innocent.</p>\n<p><strong>Wade, so much of your career as a dancer and choreographer, is tied to Michael. Do you think you could have had the career you had without him?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Robson:</em> The exact career? No. Michael was the physical access point with which I was first introduced to dance. A good deal about my fear in talking about this, in telling the truth, was that my whole life, including my career, would fall apart. Once I began talking about it, everything got painted black. I quit everything: dance, music, film, everything I’d ever known because it was all tied to Michael. If I started dancing, there’s Michael, in my body. That was the feeling. So I stopped all of it for five years. I didn’t dance for five years. And I never thought I would ever again in my life.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, just over a year and a half ago, I’d done enough internal work and done enough pulling these things apart&#8212;separating him from art in my life and dance in my life&#8212;somehow dance flew back into my heart and I started trying to approach it differently, being more playful and not so outcome-oriented, which is so much of the seriousness that he put into me. Everything was about being the best, ruling the world, changing the world, all these insanely heavy expectations for something that is artistic and is supposed to be experimental and joyful.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s it like for both of you when you hear a Michael Jackson song today?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Safechuck:</em> It’s still really hard for me. And I don’t think a day goes by where I don’t hear a song. You go out to have a drink with your friend, you’re trying to relax and let everything go, and he’ll come on. Every time. It’s hard. It gets easier, but it’s still hard.</p>\n<p><em>Robson:</em> In the beginning, I was extremely sensitive to it. I would be at a lunch or a dinner with my wife, my child, and something would come on, and it would take over my whole body and I would have to leave the place. It’s rarely that physically intense now, unless I’m in a place for children, a playground, an inside gym. In those types of situations, a Michael song will come on and it’s a place that is supposed to protect children. That’s really difficult.</p>\n<p><em>Safechuck:</em> You know what is a hard one for me: my kids love <strong>Weird Al [Yankovic]</strong> and they love [the “Bad” parody] “Fat.” They love it! And I’m like, God, do I take this away from my kids?</p>\n<p><em>Robson:</em> My son came home from school one day, a few years ago, and he said, check out this thing my friend taught me: and he did some version of the Moonwalk. It was extremely triggering to me but then, as a parent, I’m trying to stop myself, because I don’t want to put my issues on him. But Michael is everywhere. It’s challenging.</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories from <em>Vanity Fair</em></h3>\n<p>&#8212; What 2019’s Oscar nominees <a

Proceed with care.</h4>\n<p>Blinked and you might have missed <strong>Michael Rooker’s</strong> debut in <em>True Detective</em> last week as the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/true-detective-michael-rooker-hoyt-season-3\">camera briefly lingered</a> on a photo of his mysterious character, an Arkansas tycoon named Edward Hoyt. Though audiences still have yet to see Hoyt in action on the series, we did get a lengthier taste of what Rooker might have in store for us <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/true-detective-hoyt-pink-room-season-3-episode-6-kidnap-julie\">as the Big Bad</a> via a menacing phone call that closed out this week’s episode. In the latest installment of <em>Vanity Fair</em>’* <em>Still Watching: True Detective</em> podcast, director <strong>Daniel Sackheim</strong> both teases what we might expect from Rooker in the finale and why it took him some convincing to cast his good friend in the role.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://player.megaphone.fm/PPY2550052150?light=true\"><iframe height=\"360\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://player.megaphone.fm/PPY2550052150?light=true\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>Sackheim confirms what others have <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/true-detective-hoyt-daughter-gerald-kindt-bill-clinton-lucy-purcell-harris-james\">noted elsewhere</a> this season, namely that the character of Edward Hoyt and Hoyt Foods are “inspired by” a real-life power player in 1980s and 90s Arkansas: Don Tyson of Tyson Foods fame. In 1966, Tyson was named president of the company his father founded, and under his leadership the company grew from a multi-million-dollar company to a multi-billion-dollar global power. Tyson plunged his fingers deep in the political landscape of Arkansas and, later, when his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1992/03/22/in-arkansas-the-game-is-chicken/6244e0fa-5416-4a6a-bae8-a229b854ed98/?utm_term=.a7f421ca90fa\">early investment</a> in local politician <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> paid off, had strong connections to the White House as well. Sackheim admits that Rooker&#8212;who often plays intimidating shit-kicker types&#8212;didn’t strike him as the right match for a “captain of industry.” That’s when series creator <strong>Nic Pizzolatto</strong> introduced Sackheim to footage of the real Don Tyson.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row iframe\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><div class=\"embed iframe-embed-component \" data-type=\"iframe\" data-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pUY9eM4qEgU\"><iframe height=\"360\" width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pUY9eM4qEgU\"></iframe></div></div></div><p>“He was a guy who came to work every day in a khaki jumpsuit and a trucker hat,” Sackheim says, “who was as much on the chicken line as he was in the corporate office.” Tyson got his start in the family business as a chicken catcher and truck driver, prompting Sackheim to call him a “self-made man.” As self-made as you can be with your name on the logo of the company, anyway.</p>\n<p>Though Hoyt’s not-so-veiled phone threats to <strong>Mahershala Ali’s</strong> Wayne at the end of Episode 7 were enough to chill Detective Hays to the bone, Sackheim further explains that Don Tyson&#8212;and by extension Edward Hoyt&#8212;is not a particularly “sophisticated or eloquent” figure. He expects Rooker’s performance is, perhaps, not what audiences might have pictured Hoyt to be. No wonder <em>True Detective</em> kept this particular casting <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/true-detective-michael-rooker-hoyt-season-3\">under wraps</a>. Sackheim calls Rooker’s turn in Episode 8&#8212;where he’s due to square off opposite Ali&#8212;“magnificent.”</p>\n<p>The Don Tyson connection isn’t the only real-world inspiration to enhance the authentic Arkansas flavor of <em>True Detective</em> Season 3. Pizzolatto’s childhood in Louisiana may have given Season 1 its potent bayou vibe, but the show-runner went to graduate school at the University of Arkansas, and his fascination with a state that, Sackheim says, was very “near and dear” to his heart resulted in this season’s sideways examination of the power structures in place there. Though Sackheim says he “never asked” if the character of Attorney General Gerald Kindt was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/true-detective-hoyt-daughter-gerald-kindt-bill-clinton-lucy-purcell-harris-james\">inspired by real-life Arkansas Attorney General Bill Clinton</a>, the many controversies swirling around the Clinton dynasty have seeped into the Season 3 narrative.</p>\n<p>Take, for instance, Elisa’s (<strong>Sarah Gadon</strong>) Episode 7 insistence that pedophilia and sex trafficking are somehow connected to the disappearance of Julie Purcell and the murder of her brother, Will.  This theory of Elisa’s&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/true-detective-season-3-theories-debunked-season-1-connection\">which seems largely dismissed by the episode itself</a>&#8212;is overtly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_child_prostitution_ring_allegations\">connected to the debunked Franklin conspiracy</a>, but also, less directly, to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzagate_conspiracy_theory\">debunked Pizzagate conspiracy</a> that dogged the 2016 <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> election campaign.</p>\n<p>Similarly, with the Clintons on the brain, it’s hard to avoid thinking of the Whitewater scandal of the 1990s that linked the White House to both a real-estate controversy back in Arkansas and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/5/25/11761128/vince-foster\">the death of Clinton’s deputy White House counsel Vince Foster</a>. Despite many, many, many investigations, there’s no evidence that Foster’s death was anything other than a suicide. But that hasn’t stopped many notable figures over the years&#8212;including <strong><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-escalates-attack-on-bill-clinton/2016/05/23/ed109acc-2100-11e6-8690-f14ca9de2972_story.html?utm_term=.61b12866acbb\">Donald Trump</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/why-was-kavanaugh-obsessed-with-vince-foster.html\">Brett Kavanaugh</a></strong>&#8212;from implying some sort of staged conspiracy and cover-up. As we learned this week on <em>True Detective,</em> staging suicides seems to be one of Hoyt’s favorite ways of eliminating troublesome figures like Tom and Lucy Purcell.</p>\n<p>Even more pertinently&#8212;though still firmly in the realm of conspiracy&#8212;is the case of the Boys on the Tracks. In this week’s episode, Elisa points out to Wayne how many people around the Purcell case went missing or turned up dead over the years. Tom, Lucy, Harris James, Cousin Dan, Brett Woodard, etc.</p>\n<p>In 1987, 17-year-old Kevin Ives and and his best friend, 16-year-old Don Henry, were found dead on train tracks in Alexander, Arkansas. Initial autopsies alleged that the boys had fallen asleep on the tracks after reportedly smoking 20 joints of marijuana. But <a href=\"http://swordandscale.com/the-boys-on-the-tracks/\">other evidence</a>&#8212;including, allegedly, stab wounds&#8212;indicated that the boys, much like Will Purcell, were likely killed elsewhere and dragged to a second location, where their bodies were found. The case remains unsolved, and is considered one of the most <a href=\"https://thoughtcatalog.com/julia-metraux/2019/01/heres-the-most-harrowing-unsolved-murder-from-every-state/\">unsettling</a> cold cases in the nation. <strong><a href=\"http://maraleveritt.com/books-by-mara-leveritt/\">Mara Leveritt</a></strong>&#8212;an Arkansas reporter who famously wrote about the West Memphis Three and is something of an inspiration for the Amelia character&#8212;wrote <em>The Boys on the Tracks: Death, Denial, and a Mother’s Crusade to Bring Her Son’s Killers to Justice</em> about Linda Ives’s quest for the truth about her son’s death.</p>\n<p>Ives and a number of others who have looked into the case believe that the government was somehow involved; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/4g1qn2/who_put_the_bodies_of_don_henry_16_and_kevin_ives/\">the most popular theory among those who favor conspiracies</a> paints Kevin and Don’s deaths as a massive cover-up after the boys stumbled upon a drug-related government operation. Clinton was the governor of Arkansas at the time&#8212;so, as you can imagine, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clinton_Chronicles\">his name has been tied up with this case in certain circles for years</a>. Much like the Purcell case, <a href=\"https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2017/08/the-mysterious-case-of-the-arkansas-train-deaths/\">back in the 1980s</a>, a number of people who either knew about the Boys on the Tracks or were slated to testify died mysteriously. While it’s true a number of people of interest died for a number of different causes, no direct link to the case itself has ever been proven.</p>\n<p>Though he may not be trying to make any kind of pointed commentary about the Clintons via the lurid crimes of <em>True Detective</em> Season 3, Pizzolatto loves broad conspiracies <a href=\"https://jezebel.com/did-a-horrifying-real-satanic-sex-abuse-case-inspire-tr-1533541931\">based on real-life horrors</a> and shadowy government cover-ups.

The event was a comedic feat in itself: how do you satirize concerts while also putting on an entertaining concert? Successfully, it seems; Vulture’s <strong>Jesse David Fox</strong> noted in his <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/the-lonely-island-first-concert-ever-clusterfest-review.html\">review</a> that the group embraced its goofy qualities to put on, as Fox affectionately put it, “a big dumb show.”</p>\n<p>Now, one year later, the guys are going on tour for two weeks. Their multi-city adventure will kick off in June at Bonnaroo in Manchester, Tennessee, on June 15, with eight dates in cities including Washington, D.C., New York City, and Philadelphia. Tickets go on sale March 1, and fans can also register as “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/thelonelyisland/status/1098239537778634752\">Verified Fans</a>” to access pre-sale tickets.

According to HBO’s description, the film includes interviews with both Safechuck and Robson&#8212;now 40 and 36 years old, respectively&#8212;along with their families, which combine to form “a portrait of sustained abuse, exploring the complicated feelings that led both men to confront their experiences after both had a young son of his own.”</p>\n<p>Michael Jackson’s estate&#8212;which still plans to bring the M.J.-themed jukebox musical <em>Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough</em> to Broadway <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/michael-jackson-broadway-musical-allegations-leaving-neverland\">in 2020</a>&#8212;decried  <em>Leaving Neverland</em> in January. “This is yet another lurid production in an outrageous and pathetic attempt to exploit and cash in on Michael Jackson,” the family wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/michael-jackson-documentary-leaving-neverland-surviving-r-kelly\">statement</a>. The estate used even harsher words to describe the film in a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/michael-jackson-estate-calls-neverland-doc-tabloid-character-assassination\">later statement</a>, calling the project “the kind of tabloid character assassination Michael Jackson endured in life, and now in death.” Jackson, who died in 2009, did face accusations of abuse when he was alive as well: the musician was indicted on charges including four counts of molesting a minor in 2004. In 2005, a jury found him not guilty on all charges. Jackson was also accused of sexually abusing a 13-year-old boy in 1993, and settled out of court with the boy’s family for more than $20 million in 1994.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/02/leaving-neverland-trailer-michael-jackson-hbo-documentary-dan-reed-1202560263/\">Deadline</a>, HBO said last week that it had no plans to meet with representatives from Jackson estate, which has continued to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/michael-jackson-estate-leaving-neverland-letter-channel-4\">push back</a> against the film with claims the filmmakers never approached Jackson’s estate, or any of his family, friends, or defenders while assembling their documentary. “Those concerned should be given an appropriate and timely opportunity to respond,” a letter from the estate’s representative reportedly read. “I think we can all agree that the false allegations being made in your ‘documentary’ are ‘significant allegations’ . . . it is hard to imagine more significant accusations that can possibly be made against anyone.”</p>\n<p>Responding to the controversy surrounding the doc at the T.C.A.s, Deadline reports that HBO’s <strong>Casey Bloys</strong> said, “The one thing I would say about this documentary is I would ask everybody to watch it and make their judgments after seeing it.”</p>\n<h3>More Great Stories

to Broadway in the summer of 2020.","body":"<p>Three weeks after a haunting Michael Jackson documentary <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/michael-jackson-documentary-leaving-neverland-stuns-at-sundance\">debuted at</a> the Sundance Film Festival, raising new <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/michael-jackson-documentary-leaving-neverland\">sexual abuse claims</a> against the late singer, Jackson’s estate has made it known that it will continue with plans to launch a stage musical based on the life and works of the late musician, titled <em>Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough.</em></p>\n<p>The news was folded into a report from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/theater/michael-jackson-chicago-musical-cancelled.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a> stating that the Jackson estate and producing partner Columbia Live Stage would be canceling a planned Chicago premiere for the show. Though that run is being halted, the estate still hopes to unveil the musical&#8212;with a book by two-time Pulitzer Prize winner <strong>Lynn Nottage</strong> and directing and choreography by Tony winner <strong>Christopher Wheeldon</strong>&#8212;on Broadway in the summer of 2020. The official reason given for the Chicago cancellation was not the press around the documentary, <em>Leaving Neverland</em>&#8212;which will air on HBO in early March&#8212;but “scheduling difficulties” brought on because of a labor dispute.</p>\n<p>According to the <em>Times,</em> “the musical will focus on the period of time leading up to Jackson’s ‘Dangerous’ world tour which began in 1992.”</p>\n<p>Jackson’s family has remained adamant that the <em>Leaving Neverland</em> documentary&#8212;which details Jackson’s <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/michael-jackson-documentary-leaving-neverland-stuns-at-sundance\">alleged sexual abuse</a> of <strong>Wade Robson</strong> and <strong>James Safechuck</strong> when they were children&#8212;is <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/02/michael-jackson-estate-leaving-neverland-letter-channel-4\">“disgraceful”</a> and “tabloid character assassination.”</p>\n<p>In a televised interview late last month, Jackson’s surviving brother <strong>Jermaine</strong> said that he was “1,000 percent sure” Michael was not guilty of what Robson and Safechuck have accused him of, “because [he] was tried by a jury and . . . he was acquitted on all of this.” (Jackson was indicted on charges including four counts of molesting a minor in 2004; in 2005, a jury found him not guilty on all charges. Jackson was also accused of sexually abusing a 13-year-old boy in 1993, and settled out of court with the boy’s family for more than $20 million in 1994.) Jermaine <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/01/michael-jackson-documentary-leaving-neverland\">added</a>, “Our family is tired. Let this man rest. He did a lot for the world. Let him rest. I’ll just say this: there is no truth to this documentary.”</p>\n<p>Jackson’s estate recently sent <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2019/02/11/michael-jackson-estate-leaving-neverland-violates-channel-standards/\">a letter</a> to the U.K.’s Channel 4 in hopes that it would pull <em>Leaving Neverland</em> from its schedule. The estate argued that the documentary “violates the network’s programming guidelines,” in that the filmmakers did not seek a response from Jackson’s estate, family, or friends about the allegations made within the film. The network, however, has already dismissed the letter&#8212;claiming that the allegations against Jackson <em>are</em> rebutted in the film by denials Jackson made himself before dying in 2009.</p>\n<p>“On this occasion the person against whom the significant allegations are being made is deceased,” the network responded. “It is therefore appropriate that his denials during life are included in the program.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/57487bb333948c1a4300000a.js?muted=1\"></div></div>","rubric":"LEAVING NEVERLAND","socialTitle":"Michael Jackson’s Family Continuing with Stage Musical in Spite of Shocking New Allegations","socialDescription":"The Michael Jackson estate hopes to bring the jukebox musical to Broadway in the summer of 2020.","seoTitle":"Michael Jackson’s Family Continuing with Stage Musical in Spite of Shocking New Allegations","seoDescription":"The Michael Jackson estate hopes to bring the jukebox musical to Broadway in the summer of 2020.","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Movies","issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","interactiveOverride":"","contentType":"","textMimeType":"","tags":["michael jackson"],"revisionAuthor":"Hillary Busis","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"id":"5c65b83e9e70dd2f91afe5fb","revision":33,"createdAt":"February 14, 2019 1:49 pm","modifiedAt":"February 14, 2019 4:40 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"February 14, 2019 4:40 pm","_embedded":{"categories-channels":[{"fields":{"name":"Hollywood","slug":"hollywood","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f11fae03af0739cf33e0","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}},{"fields":{"name":"Movies","slug":"movies","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5ae9f120c639a3587939aa6b","revision":0,"createdAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modifiedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"May 2, 2018 1:10 pm","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"categories-tags":[{"fields":{"name":"michael jackson","slug":"michael-jackson","revisionAuthor":"aviator-scripts-categories-migration","meta":{"collectionName":"categories","modelName":"category","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":true},"id":"5b4cb8036e1c450b65047cd9","revision":0,"createdAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modifiedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","revisionCreatedAt":"July 16, 2018 11:21 am","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"photos":{},"hierarchy":[],"parent":[],"root":[]}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"bio":"Julie Miller is a Senior Hollywood writer for <em>Vanity Fair</em>’s website.
