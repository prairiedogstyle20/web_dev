President Trump’s approval rating is up 9 points since Friday, February 1.
President Trump’s approval rating reached 52% on Monday following the State of the Union Address last Tuesday.
Barack Obama’s approval rating was at 50% at a similar point in his presidency.
This is also despite national mainstream media reporting negatively on the highly successful President Trump  92% of the time .
Barack Obama had a cake walk with the media.
When President Trump gets a chance to tell his side of the story — unfiltered — and he gets a chance to tell THE FULL STORY with all of his accomplishments that are ignored by the state-run media his approval ratings skyrocket.
Trump should hold quarterly addresses to the nation.
