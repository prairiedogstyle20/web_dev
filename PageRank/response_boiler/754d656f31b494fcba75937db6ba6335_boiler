President Trump recently reaffirmed his call for border security, and called on lawmakers to “stop playing political games.”
Lets just call them WALLS from now on and stop playing political games! A WALL is a WALL!

In a series of tweets Thursday, the president said large sections of the wall have already been built or are under construction. He added, renovating existing walls is a big part of the plan to properly secure our border “after many decades.”
He went on to say, “the wall is getting done one way or the other.”

In follow up tweet, the president said Republicans are wasting their time, because Democrats won’t give money for a “desperately needed wall” despite evidence, proof, and the influx of migrant caravans.
The president concluded by saying, “I got you covered,” and said he doesn’t expect much help.
Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee are wasting their time. Democrats, despite all of the evidence, proof and Caravans coming, are not going to give money to build the DESPERATELY needed WALL. I’ve got you covered. Wall is already being built, I don’t expect much help!
