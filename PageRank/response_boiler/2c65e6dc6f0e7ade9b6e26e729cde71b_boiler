OK, so first of all, that response undermines Pelosi’s earlier statement condemning Omar’s remarks.
And second of all, she’s lying through her teeth.
Pelosi is just wrong on this count. The Trump campaign *did* denounce the "Jew-S-A" chant. https://t.co/3vJlni1N55

Indeed. The day after the rally in question, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway denounced the lone attendee who chanted “Jew-S-A,” saying “His conduct is completely unacceptable and does not reflect our campaign or our candidate.” Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks also condemned the anti-Semitic chant:
"The GOP nominee's spokeswoman Hope Hicks said the campaign “strongly condemns this kind of rhetoric and behavior,” in a statement to Politico. "It is not acceptable at our rallies or elsewhere." https://t.co/x2tZ3dWRBB

Pants on fire, Nancy.

Basically.
The Trump campaign and administration, like any campaign or administration, should be held accountable for what they’ve said and done, but to compare a random rally attendee with a sitting Democratic and anti-Semitic member of Congress — especially considering that the Trump campaign did, in fact, denounce this instance of anti-Semitism — is disingenuous and low. In other words, par for the Nancy Pelosi course.
