Canada's Milos Raonic and Denis Shapovalov are off to the second round of the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament.
The fourth-seeded Raonic downed Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber 7-6 (8), 7-5 in a first-round match on Tuesday.
Shapovalov, seeded 10th, then beat Croatian qualifier Franko Skugor 7-5, 6-3.
It marked Raonic's first match since a quarter-final loss to Lucas Pouille at the Australian Open last month. After that match, Raonic said he suffered a knee injury.
World No. 14 Raonic, of Thornhill, Ont., didn't face an easy draw as Kohlschreiber is ranked 32nd.
Shapovalov, of Richmond Hill, Ont., is ranked 25th, well ahead of the 351st-ranked Skugor.
