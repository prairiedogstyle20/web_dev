Richard Elliott speaks softly but the Alliance High School senior has carried a powerful ball for the boys team the last four years.
Elliott has posted one of the top interscholastic averages for the Aviators since he made the bowling team as a freshman, surpassing the 200-mark in several games.
Saving the best for his senior season, Elliott is averaging a rock-solid 220, helping Alliance compile one of the better records in both the Greater Stark County Bowling Conference and the Eastern Buckeye Conference.
For taking his game, which was at a high level in his first three years, to an even higher level, Elliott was selected The Review Male Athlete of the Week.
"He's not only been a great bowler for us, but he's been a clutch bowler for us," Alliance head coach Aaron Hill Sr. said. "He's not afraid of being in a pressure situation, he loves it."
Elliott, a right-hander with a powerful hook, recalls helping the Aviators rally from 50 pins down to defeat New Philadelphia in a match this season. Anchoring the team, he rolled six straight strikes to secure the team win.
"I love being the anchor because it motivates me to do well," Elliott said. "There is a lot of pressure with being the anchor because a match often is determined by the person in that position. But that is fine with me. The more pressure, the more I like it."
Elliott has been around bowling for almost his entire life. He was exposed to the game by his father, Richard, at an extremely early age.
"I was 2 years old when I threw my first ball," Elliott said. "I don't remember it [from] memory, of course, because I was too young. But we took a pictures of it. I was standing there with my dad, and I saw the bumpers along the lane."
His early experience transitioned into intense interest six years later when Elliott began bowling on a regular basis.
"I started taking it seriously when I was 8 years old," he added. "I'd practice four, five times a week with my father, who's a good bowler."
With more practice, Elliott became a more polished bowler and was good enough to become a starter during his freshman year, showing a similar style to Ronnie Brimlow, a previous Alliance standout.
During his sophomore year, Elliott nearly reached perfection in one game against Lowellville. He rolled 11 consecutive strikes and was within one more of a 300, but he left the 9 pin standing on his final attempt, finishing with a 299.
"When you leave the 9 pin, you're too close to the head pin," Elliott said. "When I'm getting strikes, my ball finds the pocket."
Elliott, who stands 6-foot and weighs 170 pounds, says his physique suits his power game.
"I have long legs and that helps me, because I throw the ball hard," Elliott said. "It's been [timed] at 18 mph and the average is around 15. I also throw a hook, which also helps me."
Elliott bowls but doesn't limit himself to one sport. He also was a member of the boys golf team and the baseball team and considers himself a three-sport athlete.
"There is athleticism in bowling," Elliott said. "You have to take the correct [and coordinated] steps on your approach. You have to have good balance. You have to keep your hand on the ball in order to have control of it."
Not only did Elliott seriously flirt with a 300 during his sophomore season, he also was a member of the Alliance team which finished ninth in the state tournament in Columbus.
"That was surreal," he said. "We faced a lot of great teams we had never seen before, teams from all over the state. We just missed making the cut for the finals [where eight teams competed for a title], but it was a great experience."
Teammate Sean Kelly is the only other link to that state tournament team. With his high school career winding down, Elliott lists earning another state tournament trip high on his priority list.
"I hope to get my average up over 220, but I also want to help my team get back down to state again, not just myself," he said. "I'm pretty serious during my matches, focusing on my game, unless the team needs energy. I'll get more vocal and get the other guys pumped up, encouraging them to do well. That's what a team is about."
Elliott, an honor student, envisions a career in welding after he graduates from high school. That is one post-scholastic goal.
"I love welding, but I want to weld and pursue a bowling career," he said.
