In a tweet, Omar accused the president of discrimination against "Jews, Muslims, Indigenous, immigrants, black people and more," adding that she learned from “people impacted” by comments she made that many, including fellow Democrats, called anti-Semitic.

"Hi @realDonaldTrump- You have trafficked in hate your whole life—against Jews, Muslims, Indigenous, immigrants, black people and more. I learned from people impacted by my words. When will you?" she tweeted Wednesday morning.

Her comments come after the president called for her resignation or removal from the House Foreign Affairs Committee over her tweet questioning the influence of the Israel lobby, namely the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), in Washington D.C.
Omar faced a wave of backlash and apologized for the tweet, pledging to listen to the Jewish community while affirming her stance against AIPAC.
"Anti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes," Omar wrote. "My intention is never to offend my constituents or Jewish Americans as a whole. We have to always be willing to step back and think through criticism, just as I expect people to hear me when others attack me for my identity. This is why I unequivocally apologize."
Trump told reporters Tuesday that he found Omar's apology inadequate, calling her response "lame" and reiterating his demand for her resignation.
“Anti-Semitism has no place in the United States Congress,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting. “And I think she should either resign from Congress or she should certainly resign from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.”
