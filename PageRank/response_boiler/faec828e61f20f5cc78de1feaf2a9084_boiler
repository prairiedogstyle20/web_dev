The acting deputy director of ICE recently defended President Trump’s immigration policy, and said Congress is not doing its job to protect the border.
In an interview Monday, top official Matt Albence said lawmakers in Washington are to blame for the increase of family arrests at the border. He suggested that they have failed to address the changing demographics crossing.
Albence said the type of people crossing has shifted from single adult males to whole family units, who cannot be processed fast enough.

Albence then addressed the Democrats demands to impose a detention bed cap, which is holding up border security negotiations.
“The president’s budget asked for 52,000 beds, which is really what me need to get the job done,” said the ICE official. “Congress hasn’t seemed fit to fund us at that level, we asked for that last year as well, but when you’re talking about the cap on the ICE beds it’s particularly disturbing because that means we’ll be releasing at least 10,000 criminals back into the communities — that means when the law enforcement agency arrests somebody for domestic violence of for sexual assault of a minor that is in this country illegally, ICE won’t be able to come and puck them up and if they did then we’ll probably have to release them because we wont have money to detain them.”
According to Albence, ICE arrested 11,000 more illegal criminals in President Trump’s first year in office than during Obama’s final year as president.
