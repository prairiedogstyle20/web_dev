Los Angeles, CA – On the heels of a dramatic, season-long six-game road trip, the Clippers (31-27) return home to take on the Suns (11-47) in their last game before the All-Star break.
The journey featured three different comebacks of 20 points or more, including franchise records set a week apart, an action-packed trade deadline, and a career performance from the reigning Sixth Man of the Year. Lou Williams scored 45 points against the Timberwolves on Monday night; the outburst marked the second highest single-game scoring total of his career and the most points by any NBA player off the bench since 2009.
After a slow start to his season, Patrick Beverley has turned a corner. He’s shooting 47% from three-point range over the past 30 games – and a scorching 61.5% in the month of February. One of his best performances of the season came against the Suns on January 4th, when he scored 16 points while making four of his seven shots from behind the arc.
Opponent Outlook
The Suns have struggled lately, losing 14 straight games, and 21 out of their last 23 overall. Despite the team’s rough stretch, shooting guard Devin Booker has continued his ascent as one of the top young players in the league. He is one of just three players averaging 24 points and 6.5 assists on the season – James Harden and LeBron James are the other two.
Wednesday night marks the fourth and final meeting of the season between the two teams. The Clippers have won all three games thus far, including a thrilling, back-and-forth overtime affair in early December.
Injury Report
Wilson Chandler (right quad strain) and Luc Mbah a Moute (knee) are both out.
T.J. Warren (ankle) and De’Anthony Melton (ankle) have been ruled out for the Suns.
