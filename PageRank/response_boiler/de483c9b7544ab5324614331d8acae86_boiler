Former Fox and NBC News host Megyn Kelly lashed out in response to a vulgar anti-Trump message from comedienne Sarah Silverman.
Silverman took umbrage with the President for mocking Senator Amy Klobuchar’s 2020 presidential campaign announcement. An announcement that included a strong platform of fighting global warming … as she stood in a driving snowstorm.
“Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures,” Trump scoffed. “Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)!”

Silverman, in kind, responded with a measured tone and well-thought-out counterarguments.
Just kidding, she apparently blurted out the first few things that came to her mind using the limited vocabulary she’s been graced with.
It’s been edited for those of us with some semblance of decorum …
 
Kelly, not exactly known for her warm and fuzzy relationship with President Trump, blasted Silverman in an angry tweet that pointed out the so-called funny woman is a star in children’s movies and should maybe act accordingly.
Kelly and Trump’s Relationship
You know you’ve seriously crossed some boundaries when Megyn Kelly comes to the defense of Donald Trump.
Kelly’s star rose as an anchor at Fox News only to find herself caught up in  controversy with President Trump  and eventually leaving it all behind to be a top star at NBC. An endeavor that also failed.
This past June, Kelly took the animosity up a notch when she claimed First Lady Melania Trump had sold her body for exploitation through modeling just like porn star Stormy Daniels had.
Kelly and Silverman Share Their Own Controversy
Ironically, Kelly and Silverman share a topic of controversy relevant to current events – blackface.
Kelly essentially lost her job by giving  a bizarre defense  of dressing up in blackface for Halloween, prompting a backlash from  Hollywood hypocrites  who have actually defended or performed the same controversial practice.
Guess who one of those hypocrites is? That’s right: Sarah Silverman.

Except, Silverman and the other Hollywood liberals never lost their job over actually doing something Kelly only talked about.
Television personality Nick Cannon recently slammed Silverman, Jimmy Kimmel, and Jimmy Fallon for their actions in dressing up in blackface.
“Are these your Kings of Late Night?” he asked in an Instagram post . “You know I’m always on the side of the comedian and never pander to the sensitive, but I feel there needs to be some ‘truth & reconciliation’ discussions and teachable moments amongst our communities.”

Seems Silverman needs a few teachable moments herself. Good on Megyn Kelly for calling out her despicable comments.
