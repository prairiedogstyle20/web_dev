The Daily Beast on Wednesday falsely attributed quotes to the El Paso district attorney, even though no one from the DA's office had communicated with them, according to a spokeswoman from the office.
In the story, The Daily Beast's Pilar Melendez reported that El Paso District Attorney Jaime Esparza told the media outlet that he would not be pressing charges against an assailant who attacked the media during President Trump's rally in El Paso, Texas, Monday night.
During the disturbance, BBC cameraman Ron Skeans was "violently pushed and shoved by a member of the crowd," a BBC spokesman said.
"F--- the media," the man shouted before he was ushered out of the venue.

The individual "was not immediately identified but was wearing a 'Make America Great Again' hat,"  NBC reported. Of course, most of the people at the event were wearing red MAGA hats.

"The man was removed by security and Ron is fine," the BBC statement said. "The president could see the incident and checked with us that all was OK. It is clearly unacceptable for any of our staff to be attacked for doing their job."
The Daily Beast initially reported that the Esparza told them that he would not be pressing charges against the assailant.
The headline caused confusion and consternation on Twitter, with some readers demanding to know why the DA, who happens to be a Democrat , wasn't pressing charges:
That's ridiculous! Why would you not press charges?
