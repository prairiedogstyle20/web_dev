In a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, President Trump addressed the recent controversy concerning Rep. Ilhan Omar’s recent anti-Israel comments, saying “Congressman Omar, it’s terrible what she said. And I think she should either resign from Congress, or she should certainly resign from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.”

The President expressed doubts to the sincerity of the apology Rep. Omar issued on Monday over the statements. He said, “What she said was so deep seated in her heart, that her lame apology, and thats what it was it was lame and she didn’t mean a word of it, was just not appropriate. I think she should resign from Congress, frankly. But at a minimum she shouldn’t be on committees, and certainly that committee.”
President Trump was referring to the below apology that Omar tweeted responding to backlash from previous anti-Israel and anti-Semitic Twitter comments.

Ilhan Omar’s response to a tweet questioning the U.S political motive in supporting Israel was the beginning of the controversy. She claimed that U.S politicians sacrifice free speech to defend Israel because of some ambiguous monetary incentive, or “the Benjamins”.

Batya Ungar-Sargon, an editor at Forward , questioned Omar’s response, asking who she thought was paying American politicians to support Israel.
Would love to know who @IlhanMN thinks is paying American politicians to be pro-Israel, though I think I can guess. Bad form, Congresswoman. That’s the second anti-Semitic trope you’ve tweeted. https://t.co/FTCaCe7WyG

Omar claimed that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) was doing so.
