Fox News host Sean Hannity delivered a must see message on the new border wall deal and offered President Donald Trump a critical piece of advice.
During his show on Monday night, Hannity kicked-off a segment discussing Trump’s massive rally on Monday night in El Paso, Texas.

The president’s rally was so large that a reported 10,000 people were inside and over 30,000 were watching outside on the big screens.
It was also reported by the Trump campaign that over 70,000 people in total RSVP’d for the event, but not everyone was able to make it.
As Hannity was speaking while the rally was still airing on a split screen, reports broke that Republicans and Democrats had reached a “deal in principle” to avert another government shutdown on Feb. 15.
Hannity called the border wall deal “garbage” and urged Trump to reject it because it doesn’t hardly offer any money to secure the border.
“By the way on this so-called compromise I’m getting details 1.3 billion? That’s not even a wall – barrier! I’m going to say this tonight and by the way we will get back to this tomorrow,” Hannity began.
“Any Republican that supports this garbage compromise, you’ll have to explain, look at the crowd, look at the country, look at CBS News, even they say 72% of the American people want the heroin to stop, the cartels to stop, the gang members to stop,” he continued.
He added: “And those that wish us ill.”
