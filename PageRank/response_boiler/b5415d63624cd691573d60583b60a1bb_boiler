NILES — For a little more than three years, Cylar Kane-Johnson has been a scoring machine for the Niles boys basketball team.
Kane-Johnson is the school’s all-time leading scorer, with the ability to drive, shoot or pass to break down a defense. The only problem over his career is that there hasn’t been much else to talk about when it comes to Niles basketball.
First-year coach Doug Foster and the Red Dragons are starting to change that perception.
Niles avenged a 26-point loss to Struthers earlier this season with a 65-58 victory over the Wildcats on Tuesday in a Northeast-8 Conference matchup at Veterans Memorial Gymnasium.
An intense, in-your-face defense along with an aggressive approach offensively that led to several players getting involved sparked another key victory for the Red Dragons (10-9, 6-6), who beat Girard last week and seem to be coming together as the postseason approaches.

“When he came in as head coach, everybody knew that the first thing he wanted to get into Niles basketball was hard-nosed defense,” Kane-Johnson said. “Over time, we’ve gotten better every game, and it’s starting to get late in the season, and I feel like everything’s starting to click at the right time. Everyone is starting to play that defense he’s been looking for, and I’m sure he was proud of that.”
Indeed, he was.
The Red Dragons showed a little bit of everything that their first-year coach has been looking for in the win over Struthers (9-10, 5-7), but defense was the key.
Niles held the Wildcats to six first-quarter points as it took an 18-6 lead. The aggressive approach continued in the second quarter, with the lead swelling to 34-15.
While Kane-Johnson had 16 points at halftime, five other players had scored as well, and the team defense was frustrating Struthers, which possesses several offensively gifted players.
“The kids are buying in to the defense-first mindset, and it really paid off tonight,” said Foster, who coached the Niles girls basketball team last year. “Tonight was a reflection of where I want this basketball team to go and this program to be. It’s physical, defense first and then see what happens. That’s what I’m looking for, and we really crossed a bridge tonight to get there.”
Struthers did fight back, twice making runs to pull within striking distance, but each time, the Red Dragons responded.
The Wildcats began the third quarter on an 8-0 run to trim the deficit to seven, yet Niles answered with a 7-0 spurt of its own. The Red Dragons’ Corbin Foy had two big buckets to halt the Struthers run, scoring five of his 14 in the quarter.
The Wildcats made another push in the fourth quarter, cutting a lead that once ballooned to 19 down to 59-55 with 1 minute, 40 seconds left to play. Foy then hit 1 of 2 free throws, Struthers turned the ball over, and Kane-Johnson hit a tough, contested lay-up to stretch the lead to seven.
Kane-Johnson finished with a game-high 28 points, and more importantly, he, Foy and fellow seniors Joe Corson and Trent Johnson made big plays at key moments to hold off the Wildcats.
“With those seniors out there on the floor, they did a nice job controlling things,” Foster said. “My son (Douglas Foster), he’s a sophomore kid, but he doesn’t turn the ball over too often. In the fourth quarter, him being on the floor I think puts them at ease a little bit because he’s going to make the right decision. And with those seniors out there — we had three seniors and two sophomores out there at the end of the game. (Sophomore Zack) Leonard came in and played some really good defense and hit some big free throws down the stretch there. I like where we’re going. I’m excited.”
So is Kane-Johnson, who admitted that while it was nice to score a lot of points during his sophomore and junior seasons, losing made it difficult to have fun.
He’s certainly enjoying his senior year, and the star guard is intrigued to see if he and the Red Dragons can take their recent stretch a step further.
“My sophomore and junior year, we had 10 wins combined,” he said, “and we just got our 10th win (tonight), so this is new to me — going into the tournament having a lot of confidence. I’ve never been this excited for a tournament game. When we get there, we get there, but yeah, it’s been fun.”
