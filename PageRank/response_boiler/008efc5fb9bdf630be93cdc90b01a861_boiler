A payday loan default can lead to a barrage of bank overdraft fees, constant collections calls, damage to your credit scores, a day in court and garnishment of your paycheck.
Don’t think it can’t happen because you borrowed only $300.
“If you have a valid, binding, legal agreement to pay that debt, and you’re in a state where they can sue you and attach your wages, you’re playing a game of chicken that you’re going to lose,” says Bruce McClary, spokesperson for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling.
You have options such as settling the debt for less than you owe or filing for bankruptcy if your debts are overwhelming.
Bank withdrawals and collection calls
Payday lenders don’t waste time when the money you owe is due.
You have options such as settling the debt for less than you owe or filing for bankruptcy if your debts are overwhelming.
They’ll immediately initiate automatic withdrawals from your bank account if you’ve given them access as part of the loan agreement. If the debits don’t go through, they may break the charge into smaller chunks in an attempt to extract whatever money is in your account.
Each failed attempt can trigger a bank fee against you. Successful attempts could drain your bank account and cause other transactions to bounce, resulting in more fees.
At the same time, lenders will start calling, sending letters from lawyers and contacting the relatives or friends you used as references when you took out the loan. By federal law, lenders can only ask for help in locating you — they can’t reveal their identity or your debt situation to anyone.
