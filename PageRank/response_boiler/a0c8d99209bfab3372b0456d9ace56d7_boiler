If we don’t do something quickly, the Trump Administration could choose the next World Bank president. That could spell disaster for the climate and the world’s poorest people. We can’t let it happen.
President Trump has now nominated David Malpass to be World Bank President. Malpass is an almost-cartoonishly bad choice: as Chief Economist of Bear Stearns, he led the global economy off a cliff into the global financial crisis in 2007. He’s also repeatedly downplayed the urgency of the climate crisis in public statements. If approved, Malpass would be a disaster for the World Bank – and the world. 
The World Bank is the most prominent global development bank, and it is one of the world’s largest sources of public funding for developing countries. Thanks to our collective pressure, the World Bank promised to dramatically scale back their financing for oil, gas, and coal. Trump could undo that massive victory unless we act.
It’s time to sound the alarm: if Trump gets his way, the big steps the World Bank has taken to cut its fossil fuel finance could be under threat. 
We need a climate champion in the driver’s seat of the World Bank for this conversation. Given that Trump is busy tweeting ridiculous lies about climate science, and his Cabinet is stacked with representatives of the fossil fuel industry, we’re not optimistic that his nominee will fit the bill. We need your help to convince other governments that it’s past time to repudiate Trump and pick a real climate leader to head the World Bank.
Tell World Bank Executive Directors to stop Trump from appointing the next World Bank President.
