Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) says he’s pitched President Donald Trump on his idea for recently convicted Mexican drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán to pay for the border wall, and the president is “strongly supportive.”
“I have, yes,” Cruz told IJR when asked Wednesday if he’s discussed the idea with Trump. “The president has said that he’s strongly supportive.”
The Republican senator made headlines Tuesday after tweeting out the proposed solution, which would reallocate “criminally forfeited” funds from El Chapo and other drug lords toward a wall on the Southern border.
IJR caught up with Cruz on Capitol Hill on Wednesday and asked the senator to explain his vision for the proposed EL CHAPO Act and detail how it would help Republicans and the president to fund a border wall.
America’s justice system prevailed today in convicting Joaquín Guzmán Loera, aka El Chapo, on all 10 counts.  U.S. prosecutors are seeking $14 billion in drug profits & other assets from El Chapo which should go towards funding our wall to #SecureTheBorder . https://t.co/hPwEUVM6SP

“One of the principal objections that Democrats have raised to building a wall is they have said they don’t want to spend taxpayer money to do so,” Cruz said. “I’ve introduced legislation that would allow funds, criminally forfeited from El Chapo and other drug lords, to be used directly for border security and to build a wall.
“The idea came many months ago as we were debating this issue,” he continued. “Public estimates of the cost to building a wall at the time were anywhere from $14 to $20 billion. And public estimates of the global value of El Chapo’s criminal assets was roughly $14 billion.
“So there’s a natural symmetry there and an elegant solution, which is to use El Chapo’s ill-gotten gains, that he got by crossing the border illegally, trafficking narcotics into this country, and to use those billions to pay for preventing future narco-traffickers or human traffickers from continuing to cross the border illegally,” Cruz added.
Trump called the idea “interesting” earlier on Wednesday but has yet to publicly fully endorse the proposal.
Congress is currently working to nail down the details of a border security deal that was reached late Tuesday night but has since hit a rough patch on its way to the president’s desk.
Trump has said he’s “not happy” about the compromise, which would only provide $1.375 billion for border barriers, a much lower number than what previous deals would have contained.
