On the 8th of February, Ayatollah Khomeini tweeted out what seems to be a threat against President Trump, John Bolton and Mike Pompeo. 
With many accounts like InfoWars and Laura Loomer being suspended, you would think Twitter would take a tweet like this serious. Four days later, the tweet is still up and Khomeini’s account hasn’t been locked.
Back on August 21st of 2018, Twitter did claim to remove 284 accounts related to a misinformation campaign originating from Iran. But they are the same company that allows Louis Farrakhan to spew his hate toward Jews. Same thing with Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib.  It seems Twitter has an obvious bias toward some groups.
So who are these groups Twitter is targeting?  At the beginning of 2018, we noticed many conservatives getting “shadow-banned” and suspended. The same thing with many of the Iranian dissident groups.  After the death of Jamal Khashoggi, we saw the entire team over at the Herald.Report  get suspended.
So why is Twitter so lenient on accounts like Khomeini, Omar and Farrakhan? We believe it has a lot to do with Jack and his own political beliefs. Each time Twitter gets caught censoring, they blame it on an algorithm issue. Here’s what he had to say to congress.
We all know it’s more than an algorithm issues since it seems to target people with similar beliefs. Since a large majority of people get their news from Twitter, is the bias fair or even legal for that matter? The US congress might want to start asking some tough questions.
