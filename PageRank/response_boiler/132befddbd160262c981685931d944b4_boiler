Spartanburg High's Steve Fuller and Stephen Davis, Greer's Steve Greer to be enshrined on April 23
Former Spartanburg quarterback Steve Fuller and running back Stephen Davis joined former Greer defensive lineman Steve Greer announced Wednesday among the five newest inductees into the South Carolina Football Hall of Fame.
The Class of 2019 also includes former University of South Carolina defensive back and return man Bobby Bryant and legacy inductee Dode Phillips, a Chester and Erskine College alum who died in 1965. The organization’s Blanchard-Rogers Trophy recipient as college player of the year, and the Humanitarian of the Year award will be revealed at a later date.
The enshrinement ceremony is scheduled for April 23 at the Hilton Greenville.
Davis is a Spartanburg native who was 1992’s top-rated recruit in the nation and USA Today’s Offensive High School Football Player of the Year. He helped lead the Vikings to the 1991 state championship. He accepted a scholarship to Auburn, where he played three seasons. He was named All-SEC his final two seasons and left as the school’s fourth all-time leading rusher and remains seventh at 2,811 yards. His 246 yards in 1994 against Arkansas is the school’s seventh-highest game total.
He was selected in the fourth round (103rd overall) in the 1996 NFL Draft by Washington, where he played seven seasons before playing three years with Carolina, where he made the Super Bowl following his first season in 2003. He ran for a career-high 1,444 yards and eight touchdowns (and led everybody with 315 rushing yards in the postseason) and finished third in NFL MVP voting.
Early in the 2004 season he suffered a serious knee injury that required microfracture surgery and in 30 games after his Panthers debut season he totaled only 818 yards on 244 carries, although he managed 12 rushing touchdowns in 2005, second highest of his career.
Davis topped 1,000 rushing yards in four seasons (surpassing 1,300 in each) and finished with 8,052 yards and 65 touchdowns on 1,945 carries in 143 career games. He ranks 41st in NFL career rushing touchdowns and 51st in rushing yards.
Fuller is an Oklahoma native who was raised in Spartanburg before going on to play at Clemson, where he became a charter member of the school’s athletic Ring of Honor in 1994 and also is in the university’s hall of fame. Fuller remains the only Clemson player twice named ACC Player of the Year and is one of the four football players in school history chosen All-American on the field and in the classroom in the same season.
Fuller started 34 of 43 career college games, completing 287 of 554 passing for 4,359 and 21 touchdowns. He also ran 535 times for 1,737 yards and 22 touchdowns. He ranks ninth all-time in both passing yards and touchdown responsibility. He was drafted 23rd overall by Kansas City in 1979 and played seven NFL seasons, most notably as Chicago’s backup to Jim McMahon in 1985 when that fabled team won the Super Bowl. He received a gold record and platinum video award for being the sixth of 10 solo singers on the team’s “Super Bowl Shuffle.”
Fuller allowed his No. 4 to be brought out of retirement to be worn by Deshaun Watson, who would win ACC Player of the Year and be a two-time Heisman Trophy finalist. Fuller is currently Hilton Head High School’s offensive coordinator.
Greer was born in the town of the same name and was a two-time winner (1963-64) of the S.C. Cass 2A Lineman of the Year, a 1964 Shrine Bowl selection and 1965 North-South All-Star pick, winning Most Valuable Lineman in both games. Named a Parade All-American, he became a three-year starter at Georgia and in 1969 was named an All-American, First-Team All-SEC and SEC Most Valuable Lineman. He went on to play in the Canadian Football League with Toronto.
He served as an assistant coach at Auburn and Georgia, ending his career at the latter in 2009 after 16 seasons as director of football operations, and was inducted into Georgia’s Circle of Honor in 2014.
Bryant, a Macon, Ga., native, was named ACC Athlete of the Year in both 1966 and 1967 while at USC (where he also lettered in baseball). He still holds USC’s record for the longest punt return of 98 yards. He was taken by Minnesota in the seventh round of the 1967 draft and played 13 seasons with the Vikings as part of the famed “Purple People Eaters” defense.
He played in two of the team’s four Super Bowls, missing two because of injury, and is second in franchise history with 51 interceptions, ranking 32nd all-time in the NFL. He was a Pro Bowl selection in 1975 and 76.
Phillips was awarded the 1958 Service to Sports Award by ACC writers, was a 1965 inductee into the NAIA Hall of Fame, and a was charter member of the S.C. Athletic Hall of Fame.
