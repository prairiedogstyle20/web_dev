WASHINGTON — The Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives was a blessing in disguise for a president who needed a foil, Republicans predicted last November. President Trump, who had only the press and the special counsel to battle with, they said, would find a useful antagonist in Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
It hasn’t exactly turned out that way.
After a series of misadventures, Mr. Trump has conspicuously laid off personal attacks aimed at Ms. Pelosi. Even as the standoff over funding a border wall appears to be finally ending with a deal seen as a defeat for the president, he has blamed unnamed Democrats but not their most prominent leader. And there has been no undermining Trumpian nickname — the president has said his moniker for Ms. Pelosi is, simply, “Nancy.”
Mr. Trump, who once stalked Hillary Clinton, the former Democratic nominee, around the presidential debate stage and continues to encourage “lock her up” chants at his rallies more than two years later, simply gazed up at Ms. Pelosi during his State of the Union address — and then found himself the target of ridicule for the picture of her giving him what appeared to be a dismissive clap of the hands .
“She has a unified Democratic caucus behind her, and she’s not intimidated,” said Representative Katherine M. Clark, Democrat of Massachusetts. “I don’t think that Donald Trump has run into that too often in his life, and he doesn’t know quite what to make of it all.”
Without his anticipated punching bag, Mr. Trump has been left searching for an alternative, delivering haphazard attacks on Democrats as they announce their presidential campaigns, trial-and-error hits on an inchoate field of 2020 contenders .
The question is whether a strategy of personal attacks that helped lift Mr. Trump to victory in 2016 will work when there’s no clear political opponent who rises above the rest.
“Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday . “Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)!”
Giving it right back, Ms. Klobuchar responded , “I wonder how your hair would fare in a blizzard?”
On Saturday, Mr. Trump officially welcomed Senator Elizabeth Warren to the presidential field, writing on Twitter : “Today Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President. Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!”
At a rally in El Paso on Monday night , Mr. Trump attacked Beto O’Rourke , the former Texas congressman who is considering a presidential bid. “We were challenged by a young man who lost an election to Ted Cruz,” Mr. Trump said. “They said, ‘Hey, you’re supposed to win in order to run.’ By the way we — I — I’m one for one.”
Democratic operatives predicted Mr. Trump’s attempts to personally demonize his political opponents won’t work when it’s not one on one.
“He’s better with a foil, but unless he can hone in on one or two people, it ends up being less than the sum of its parts,” said Brian Fallon, a former press secretary for Mrs. Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. “If he’s scattershot weighing in on everyone who announces a presidential campaign, it’s not going to have the intended effect.”

Mr. Trump’s allies disagree. “The Democratic field is both undefined and starting out with positions on the far left,” said Raj Shah, a former White House spokesman who is now advising Mr. Trump’s 2020 campaign. “Raising the profile of these out-of-touch positions and their controversies plays to the president’s advantage.”
Some of Mr. Trump’s attacks appear to be doing just that. Ms. Warren, whom Mr. Trump has long viewed as an easy target, has apologized for identifying herself as Native American for two decades, essentially admitting that she did what Mr. Trump has accused her of: misrepresenting her race.
Republican National Committee officials said they credited Mr. Trump with forcing the Native American issue back to the forefront. “The president reignited the conversation about her false Native American heritage claims last year, and she still can’t move past it,” said Ronna McDaniel, the committee’s chairwoman.
But in general, his denigration of Democratic presidential candidates is not being guided by any field data from his campaign about who his most viable opponent is, and what the candidates’ biggest weaknesses are, according to a campaign operative.
Trump officials said they viewed Senator Cory Booker, Senator Kamala Harris and Ms. Warren as the three most viable candidates, so far, to enter the race. But Mr. Trump has not landed on a strategy for diminishing Ms. Harris, and has praised her instead. “I would say, the best opening so far would be Kamala Harris,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times last month. “Better crowd, better enthusiasm. Some of the others were very flat.”
Meanwhile, he has weighed in on candidates considered second tier, as well as those who have yet to enter the race.
Ms. Klobuchar’s snow-blanketed kickoff rally turned into a briefly viral moment that Mr. Trump simply couldn’t pass up, the operative said. His strikes against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has yet to decide whether he will run, appear to be in the workshop phase.
“When I say something that you might think is a gaffe, it’s on purpose; it’s not a gaffe,” Mr. Trump said at a recent off-the-record lunch with network anchors . “When Biden says something dumb, it’s because he’s dumb.”
Rather than individuals, Mr. Trump’s campaign operatives, meanwhile, are hoping to elevate Democratic positions that seem out of step with the mainstream, like a 70 percent top tax rate, abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement and questioning American support for Israel.
The only presidential tweet backed by political advice, they said, was Mr. Trump’s broadside against the “ Green New Deal ,” an ambitious Democratic proposal that seeks to combat climate change by calling for the United States to eliminate additional carbon emissions by 2030.
Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, discussed the Green New Deal with Mr. Trump, an aide said, citing it as an example of a vulnerability for Democrats, and a way to brand them as “socialists.”
“I think it is very important for the Democrats to press forward with their Green New Deal,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday. “It would be great for the so-called ‘Carbon Footprint’ to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military — even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant!”
