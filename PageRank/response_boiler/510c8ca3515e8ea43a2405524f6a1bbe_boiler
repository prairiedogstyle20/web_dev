Here’s the full quote :
“But the governor stated that he would even allow a newborn baby to come out into the world and wrap the baby and make the baby comfortable, and then talk to the mother, and talk to the father, and then execute the baby. Execute the baby.”
Rupar clearly believes Trump is lying about Northam’s position.
Later, the WaPo‘s Gibson piled on, retweeting Rupar’s tweet and accusing Trump of spreading the type of “lie that incites violence”:
This is the kind of lie that incites violence. https://t.co/Ar2LZ2VRn1 https://t.co/RyMZaGs741

For emphasis, the link she included in her tweet was a 2016 story about “The twisted ‘dream’ of accused Planned Parenthood killer Robert Dear Jr.”
The problem with what both Rupar and Gibson asserted regarding Trump “lying” about Northam’s stance on late term abortion? They’re both wrong. Trump got it right.
Here’s Northam’s actual quote from that WTOP interview, with bolded emphasis added:
When we talk about third trimester abortions, these are done with the consent of the mother, with the consent of the physician. More than one physician, by the way. And its done in case where there may be severe deformities, where there may be a fetus that is non-viable.
So, in this particular example, if a mother is in labor I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.
Here’s the video clip:
VA gov on abortion this morning:

So, no. Trump didn’t get it wrong. Rupar did. And Gibson’s tweet amplified Rupar’s lie. You know who else helped spread this lie? Maggie Haberman , the Pulitzer Prize winning journalist for the New York Times.
This isn’t the first time I’ve seen members of the media falsely suggest Trump lied about Northam’s abortion comments. The Associated Press told a whopper, too, in a February 7th piece (bolded emphasis added):
In that speech, Trump incorrectly claimed that Gov. Ralph Northam, D-Va., when discussing late-term abortions in which the infant is severely deformed or unable to survive after birth, had said “he would execute a baby after birth.”
Except it wasn’t incorrect. Northam clearly left open the option of a baby’s life being terminated after delivery.
So. many. journalists keep spreading this misinformation. And yet the national media wonders why we don’t trust them?
