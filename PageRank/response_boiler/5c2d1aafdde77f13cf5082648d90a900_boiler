Darla Shine, wife of White House communications director and former Fox exec Bill Shine, is no stranger to controversy when it comes to Twitter TWTR, -2.30%  , where she’s been known to fan conspiracy flames around Sandy Hook truthers, Shariah Law, sunscreen and pretty much all things InfoWars.
She was back at it on Wednesday with this tweet.

As you can see, Shine garnered about 22 comments for every “like.” In other words, her “ratioed” tweet was getting completely blasted across social media, as the meme responses just kept flying:
But it wasn’t all fun and GIFs. While many shared their heartbreaking stories of childhood illness, someone brought up this snippet from an essay written by Roald Dahl , in which he said it’s “almost a crime” not to immunize your kids:
Olivia, my eldest daughter, caught measles when she was seven years old. As the illness took its usual course I can remember reading to her often in bed and not feeling particularly alarmed about it. Then one morning, when she was well on the road to recovery, I was sitting on her bed showing her how to fashion little animals out of coloured pipe-cleaners, and when it came to her turn to make one herself, I noticed that her fingers and her mind were not working together and she couldn’t do anything. “Are you feeling all right?” I asked her. “I feel all sleepy,” she said. In an hour, she was unconscious. In twelve hours she was dead.
The anti-vaxx movement has come under increased scrutiny of late, with more than 100 people infected in the U.S. this year alone. Ironically, the outbreak comes after the disease was declared eliminated in this country in 2000.
Around the world, cases of the viral illness have surged by about 50% at last count, according to the World Health Organization , which lists “vaccine hesitancy” among this year’s top 10 threats to global health.
The proportion of kids not getting inoculations has roughly quadrupled over the past 15 years, according to the CDC. As a result, about 47,000 children (or 1.3%) born in 2015 hadn’t been vaccinated by 2017, compared with just 0.3% of kids in 2001 — even though the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends routine vaccination by age 2 against “14 potentially serious illnesses,” including polio, the measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B and varicella.
Here’s the CNN segment:
As for Shine, she seemed to be savoring the backlash:
