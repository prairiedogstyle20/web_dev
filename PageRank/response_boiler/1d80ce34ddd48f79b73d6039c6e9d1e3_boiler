There are several photos and videos showing awkward and maybe cringe worthy moments between President Trump and Ivanka Trump.

“By the way, Ivanka Trump? Everybody loves Ivanka Trump," he said. "Come on, should I bring Ivanka up?” Trump said during his speech. As the crowd roared, Trump goes on to talk about how Ivanka, who is also White House adviser, asked to be with him on the trip to North Dakota.
 
"She said, 'Daddy, can I go with you?'" the President said his daughter asked him. "I said, 'yes you can,'" he added.

It’s usually not much of a big deal to see a daughter refer to her father as “daddy,” but when there is a history of awkward moments involving Donald Trump and Ivanka Trump, these recent comments make you feel a little weird. Plus, children tend to give up "daddy" in favor of "dad" before reaching adulthood.
In 2004, Donald Trump told radio host Howard Stern that it was okay to refer to Ivanka, his own daughter, as a “piece of ass.” In a 2006 interview, Trump and Stern briefly chat about her breasts in an extended conversation about her body. Stern said, “She looks more voluptuous than ever.” 
Donald Trump and Ivanka Trump appeared on “The View” in 2006 and during the segment, he casually said he would consider dating his own daughter if he wasn’t already married.

In 2013, Donald and Ivanka Trump were guests on the Wendy Williams Show and they were asked to play a game called “Fave Five.” Wendy asks Ivanka, “What’s the favorite thing you have in common with your father?” Ivanka replies, “Either real estate or golf.” When it was Trump’s turn to answer the question, he said, “I was going to say sex but I can’t relate that to her.” Although the studio audience busted into laughter, it was another moment that made us wonder why he would joke around like that about his daughter.
In 2015, Trump made a comment to Rolling Stone about his daughter. When referring to Ivanka, Trump said, “Yeah, she’s really something, and what a beauty, that one. If I weren’t happily married and, ya know, her father…”  There’s something about that statement that just doesn’t feel right.
In 2016, The Associated Press interviewed eight former crew members from “The Apprentice” and asked them about Donald Trump’s behavior on the show. Many of the crew members recalled times when Trump would make crass comments about staff members. One crew member said he made comments about a camerawoman’s rear end, and compared her beauty to his daughter Ivanka, according to the Associated Press.
