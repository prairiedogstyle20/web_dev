Controversy before final judging
There was drama among finalists that led to six group winners instead of seven competing for Best in Show.
Colton the Schipperke won the non-sporting dog category, but was disqualified from the Best in Show competition after his owner was ruled ineligible for the competition.

Broadcasters noted that there was a conflict of interest between the dog’s exhibitors and the judges . They also noted that this type of disqualification isn’t uncommon on the dog show circuit, but is for a show as prestigious as Westminster.
The Associated Press reported that one of Colton’s owners also co-owned dogs with the longtime partner of Best in Show judge Peter Green.
Colton was introduced on stage with the rest of the finalists, but wasn’t eligible for judging.
Crowd favorites didn’t win
Green’s decision didn’t align with a raucous crowd that cheered the loudest for Bean the Sussex Spaniel and Burns the Dachshund as they made their laps around the stage.
The victory does not come with any prize money, but King will surely be in high demand for breeding. AP reports that this is the 47th Best in Show victory for King.
