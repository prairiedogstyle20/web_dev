Legal sports betting in Kentucky could be worth at least $20 million a year in new taxes, with most of it going to the state’s struggling public pension systems, according to an analysis of a proposal in the House of Representatives.
House bill 175 would tax bookmakers’ 10.25 percent for wagers made in-person and 14.25 percent for bets made on mobile phones. John Farris, founder and managing partner of the firm Commonwealth Economics, estimated the proposal would generate at least $20.2 million each year in state tax dollars. He said that number could swell to $48 million if none of the surrounding states legalize sports betting.
“People are crying out to do it legally,” said Republican state Rep. Adam Koenig, the bill’s primary sponsor. “It is part of not just Kentucky’s culture, but America’s culture. I think it is time we bring these issues out of the shadows.”
The analysis did not consider the effects of other fees that would be required in the industry. It also did not include potential effects from fantasy sports gambling and internet poker, which would also be legalized under the proposal.
The proposal would require the state to spend a portion of the tax money on regulating the new industry and providing addiction prevention services. But the rest of it would go toward the state’s pension systems, which are at least an estimated $39 billion short of the money required to pay benefits over the next three decades, making them among the worst-funded public retirement plans in the country.
“It’s not going to fix the pension system, but every bit we can find to go to it helps,” Koenig said.
