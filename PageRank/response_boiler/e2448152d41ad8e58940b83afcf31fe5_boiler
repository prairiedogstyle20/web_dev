Conservative columnist for the Washington Post Jennifer Rubin told MSNBC on Tuesday that there was a good reason the Republican Party was attacking young, women Democrats: their usual target, Nancy Pelosi, was beating them at their own game.
Host Craig Melvin, citing reporting by Politico , said that despite the risk of a backlash, the GOP was going after Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar to rally their base, and asked “is this a smart move to shift the focus to these new up-and-comers?”
“I don’t know if it’s going to be work, so I suppose it’s not smart,” replied Rubin. “I would assume that about 1% of America knows who these people are. You and I know who AOC is but most Americans still don’t.”
“What’s more, we’re entering already a presidential primary season and those people are soon going to be seen as the primary figures in the Democratic Party,” she added. “It is quite a testament to Nancy Pelosi that she’s no longer useful to the Republicans as a foil. Probably because she’s beating Trump at his own game.”
Fellow panelist and Washington Post columnist E. J. Dionne agreed.
“The idea that the Republicans would use three women is just not a great look for them, three younger women is not a great look for them,” he said, noting that the GOP has relied on “left wing boogiemen, now women” as a rallying cry for decades. “I think the risks they run with these particular members, young and female, are very, very high for them.”
