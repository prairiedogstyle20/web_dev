(Brad Davis/The Register-Herald) WVU Tech defenders Junior Arrey, left, and Elisha Boone converge on Point Park's Cortez Allen to force a turnover Saturday afternoon at the Beckley-Raleigh County Convention Center.
The WVU Tech women have sewn up a conference championship and a date for the NAIA Division II national tournament. The men, ranked ninth in the nation, are one league win away from doing the same.
Tonight, both will step out of the River States Conference to host Bluefield State at the Beckley-Raleigh County Convention Center. The ladies will tip off at 5:30 p.m., followed by the men at 7:30 p.m.
While it’s uncommon to play a nonconference game in the last week of the regular season, complacency should not be a problem for either team.
“I am very happy with the team,” first-year women’s coach Anna Kowalska said. “They are very focused and I can see their focus in practice. I don’t hear a lot of complaining. We just want to finish strong and look forward to the conference tournament and then after that the national tournament.”
The men need a win over Rio Grande on Saturday to clinch the regular season title and automatic berth in the national tournament. Even with that carrot dangling before them, there is still business to attend to.
Both Bluefield State programs are struggling.
The Big Blues are 8-15 and average just 60.0 points per game while allowing 76.8. Leading the way is senior Korey Williams at 15.8 points per game. Junior Joseph Adeyemo pulls down 5.3 rebounds per game.
The ladies, meanwhile, bring an 8-16 record to tonight’s game. Wyoming East graduate Kara Sandy is the team’s leading scorer at 9.8 points, and PikeView alumna Lyndsey Hatfield is the top rebounder at 5.6.
That’s not all for the Tech men.
Appalachian Bible College will come to the Convention Center on Thursday for a 7 p.m. tip.
The Warriors (2-10) are led by Jacob Tincher. The sophomore guard averages 17.6 points and 7.1 rebounds, which rank him 13th and 19th, respectively, in the nation National Christian College Athletic Association Division II schools.
Wyoming East graduate Logan Davidson is right behind him in rebounds at 7.1, which is 21st in the country.
The Tech men and women seniors will be recognized on Saturday. The women tip off at 1 p.m., followed by the men at 3 p.m.
