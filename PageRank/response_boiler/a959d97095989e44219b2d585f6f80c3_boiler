Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho) on Wednesday echoed statements from Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) by confirming that he has seen no direct evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
Appearing on "America's Newsroom" Wednesday, Risch said that during the committee's two-year investigation into Russia's election meddling, they have looked at hundreds of thousands of documents and conducted more than 200 interviews.
"The president's description and Richard Burr's description are absolutely accurate as far as I'm concerned regarding this claim of collusion between President Trump and the Russians," Risch said. "It is simply not there."
Senator Richard Burr, The Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, just announced that after almost two years, more than two hundred interviews, and thousands of documents, they have found NO COLLUSION BETWEEN TRUMP AND RUSSIA! Is anybody really surprised by this?
