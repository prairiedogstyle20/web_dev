Too bad for Trump: Most voters want Congress to investigate his crimes
By
So much for “ presidential harassment .”
Though Trump has endlessly whined and complained about House Democrats investigating his finances, Russian connections, and corrupt administration officials, a new poll out Wednesday shows Americans broadly support those probes.
Sixty percent of Americans support “Democrats in Congress conducting investigations into senior officials in the Trump administration,” according to the survey, with 39 percent strongly supporting Democrats’ investigations.
“Americans overwhelmingly believe that it is Congress’s job to find out if Trump or senior administration officials have committed any crimes,” according to the survey, which was conducted by the Global Strategy Group and GBA Strategies for the Democratic-leaning group Restore Public Trust.
Trump has tweeted about what he laughably dubbed “presidential harassment” seven times since Nov. 12, shortly after Democrats retook the House majority and thus gained control of what the chamber could investigate.
“Without the phony Russia Witch Hunt, and with all that we have accomplished in the last almost two years (Tax & Regulation Cuts, Judge’s, Military, Vets, etc.) my approval rating would be at 75% rather than the 50% just reported by Rasmussen. It’s called Presidential Harassment!” Trump tweeted on Dec. 6.
Trump slammed the House probes again during his State of the Union address last week, falsely claiming that “partisan investigations” are the only thing that could stop economic growth.
“If there is going to be peace in legislation, there cannot be war and investigation,” Trump said in the speech. “It just does not work that way.”
Of course, Trump’s complaints haven’t deterred Democrats from conducting legitimate inquiries into his conduct and his administration’s activities — inquiries that the GOP blocked for the first two years of Trump’s presidency.
Since Democrats took the House majority in January, the House Intelligence Committee has reopened its Russia investigation because Republicans botched it so badly when they were in charge. Democrats have also launched their effort to finally  obtain Trump’s tax returns .
And no matter how much Trump stomps his feet and pouts, public opinion is squarely on Democrats’ side when it comes to holding Trump accountable for his potential crimes and corruption.
