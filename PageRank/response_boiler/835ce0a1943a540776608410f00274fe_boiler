YOUNGSTOWN — Devan Keevey rose up over the pesky Badger defense and threw down a one-handed dunk with 2:16 left in the third quarter.
Ursuline was up by 14 points. That’s a good barometer for the Irish. Not so good for the opposition.
Tuesday, Badger was different than the normal foes Ursuline faces and builds a solid double-figure lead against.
The Braves cut the lead to four late, but they couldn’t overcome the Irish and their own miscues in a 69-63 Irish win.
Ursuline led 35-25 at halftime and had a 45-31 lead on Keevey’s easy two.

Badger (16-4) kept chipping away at the Irish lead until Aiden Miller, who had a game-high 24 points, connected on a 3 with 3:45 remaining to pull the Braves within 58-53.
Ursuline (11-9) couldn’t shake Badger. Braves coach Josh Upshire said his team did a better job of handling the Irish press.
“I feel the second quarter we got tired a little bit,” Upshire said. “We were kind of throwing it around instead of dribbling a little bit more.
“I feel in the second half we did a lot better job of buckling down and not turning the ball over as much.”
Badger had 24 turnovers, but still hung with a tested Ursuline team that has faced the likes of Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary.

Upshire coached on Keith Gunther’s Ursuline staff for four seasons.
“Thing I’m most proud of is when you have one of your former assistants that are doing a job like he’s doing,” Gunther said. “He’s doing an unbelievable job. He’s got his kids playing at a high level. They’re playing well together. There were times we could’ve ran them out of the game, but they didn’t panic. I thought they held their composure. Every time we got up 12 to 14, they hit a big shot to get a big play.
“I thought their go-to guy was really good. I think our kids look down at the other end and think, ‘How good can they be good because they look small? They don’t look athletic. Next thing you know, they’re right in the game with you and kicking your butt.”
Miller, who Gunther praised for his play, had a three-point play with 24.8 seconds left to cut the Ursuline lead to 67-63. Badger got no closer.
“We rely on a lot of Logan Lendak (13 points) and Aiden Miller,” Upshire said. “They were kind of shying away there in the first. The halftime speech I kind of challenged them a little bit and they stepped up.”
Ursuline pulled away in the second quarter to lead by 10 at halftime. However, Miller, who recently went passed Dale Blaney as Badger’s career scoring leader, drove early in the first quarter and put down a thunderous one-handed slam in front of the Ursuline cheerleaders. That 2-1 lead was the only one Badger had the entire game.
Upshire knows his team, which is the top seed in the Division IV Grand Valley District, has to play some tough teams to be tested for this run.
“I think they understood we can compete with a team like this,” Upshire said. “This is a test I wanted us to face this year, knowing to get ready for the tournament we’ve got to see teams like Ursuline.”
The Irish were led by RJ Clark’s 19 points, while Keevey had 16, Daysean Harris put in 13 and Travis Easterly added 11.
Gunther said his team needed a test like Badger to prepare them for a Division II Boardman District, which is wide open. Ursuline is the No. 4 seed.
“We’re going to play teams like that,” Gunther said. “We’re going to play teams that are well-organized, going to move the ball, make that extra pass. They’re not going to panic in pressure situations. It’s a great test for us.
“It’s a great battle for us.”
Badger, despite the loss, are ready to face the best the D-IV tournament has to offer.
“Those kids, even though they lost, deep down in their minds they know they can win that district,” Gunther said.
Friday, Ursuline travels to Warren G. Harding. Next Tuesday, the Braves are being tested against, this time at Lakeview.
