….on Monday, The Washington Post’s fact checker refused to give Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez any Pinocchios for her blatantly false claims about her Green New Deal FAQ. Instead, the checker went after President Donald Trump.
But also on Monday, the Post decided to actually fact check leading 2020 presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) over a tweet claiming that Trump’s tax cuts were actually tax hikes on the middle class.
The tweet was referring to an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) report showing the average tax refund was down 8% compared with last year.
“Boy, talk about a non sequitur that turns out to be nonsensical and misleading,” wrote fact checker Glenn Kessler….
Of course refunds are down. People are paying less in taxes and the code is simplified. A refund means you overpaid and got money back. When you pay less the refund will be less.
Do you really not understand that?
Now do the effect of proposed Dem tax hikes has on income!!! https://t.co/Xu7Yz9ir3b
