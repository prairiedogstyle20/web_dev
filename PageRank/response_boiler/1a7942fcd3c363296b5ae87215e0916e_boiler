Davis Javorsky had a career high outing that assisted the BlueWave in capturing their first conference win versus Santa Fe College.
The Florida State College at Jacksonville BlueWave men's basketball team (0-5) faced the Saints of Santa Fe College (2-6) one last time in the final round of conference play. In their first meeting, Santa Fe had a dominating win over FSCJ at home 67-46 as the BlueWave were working to adjust to some roster changes in the new semester. The second meeting told a different story as the BlueWave went into overtime in Gainesville but fell short to Santa Fe 70-73 in an exciting match-up.
The third and final game would prove to be just as intense as their previous meeting, but the BlueWave had the home game advantage in their favor. The BlueWave started the game driven and determined to bring home their first conference win of the season in front of their crowd. That energy showed as FSCJ dominated the scoreboard the entire first half of the game keeping the Saints at bay with a 10 point lead 37-27.
The first half margin came in handy when Santa Fe started to challenge the BlueWave and narrow down the lead. The Saints won the second quarter 41-45, but the first half deficit haunted them as the final buzzer sounded and the scoreboard displayed FSCJ with 78 and the Saints 72.
David Javorsky , a freshman forward for FSCJ, led the way for the BlueWave offense scoring a career high 28 points. Javorsky connected from behind the arc hitting a total of 8 three-pointers, another career high. Teammate Marques Spann chipped in with an additional 17 points connecting for 5 three-pointers and grabbing eight boards. 
The BlueWave hit an impressive season high 15 three-pointers in one game shooting 57.7% from deep behind the arc.
BlueWave will return to action on Wednesday as they travel to the College of Central Florida (6-3) for an 8:00pm tip in their final meeting with the Patriots.
