The North Face
Later this month The North Face will be dropping another capsule collection that builds on its range of function-focused activewear. The line will be titled  Urban Active Collection, comprising items for both men and women.
The collection will boast 29 pieces in total and is divided into two sport-defined categories: Urban Active Running and Urban Active Training.  All items will be lightweight and weatherproof thanks to the inclusion of GORETEX materials.
Additionally, every item in the Urban Active Collection will rotate around a dark, monochromatic color palette, which as the Cultivation collection delivered a few weeks previously, merges minimal style with utility and function. If the preview up top is indicative of the offering as a whole, pieces will carry a vintage streetwear aesthetic, with branded side-piping, oversized fit, and elasticated waists.
Pricing and exact drop details to follow.
