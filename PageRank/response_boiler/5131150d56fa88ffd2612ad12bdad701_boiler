Fabian O’Neill
Director
Fabian was the first ever Dromore man to lift the O’Neill cup in 2007. Rumour has it that he wore his wife’s gloves in the County final and that they also share the same football boots from time to time. Father of three girls and holder of three senior championship medals you could say his hands are full! Leaves just about enough time to direct the company on the side…
Our Story!
Sean O’Neill & Fabian O’Neill, although not related, are both from the village of Dromore in Co. Tyrone. They have been great friends from youth stemming from their involvement in their local GAA club. They both went on to play in the first ever Dromore team to win a Tyrone Senior Championship. After leaving school, Sean studied teaching at St. Mary’s College Belfast and following his graduation, took up a post in his local primary School in Dromore. Fabian left school and served his apprenticeship in plastering and rendering before going on to establish his own sub-contracting business.
In an attempt to make ends meet during his college years, Sean set up a business selling merchandise to clubs called, ‘Mugs for Clubs.’ Through his dealings with clubs and organisations, Sean soon realised there was a demand for an alternative Irish owned brand to supply sportswear to clubs and societies.
Having been involved in his local club committee and coaching youth teams, Fabian further supported Sean’s vision and saw great potential in pursuing the idea and dream. Thereafter was the birth of MFC (Manufactured For Champions). With two young families both Sean and Fabian took a huge risk and left their jobs to concentrate on MFC full time. They wanted to build a team with vision and passion to help make their business a leading brand in the Irish sportswear market and beyond.
Today, MFC have established themselves as an esteemed sportswear company who supply to customers worldwide. The team continue to grow as does the demand for the product.
MFC continue to strive to fulfill their dreams and aspirations.
