Trump in ANOTHER reversal on Russia as White House says he DISAGREES with Putin's 'incredible offer' to question U.S. ambassador on 'fraud' claims
President Donald Trump called it an 'incredible offer' when Putin mentioned it
Putin proposed in exchange related to 12 Russians indicted for election hacking
He said Robert Mueller's team could go to Russia to witness but not participateÂ 
However, he said Russians would get to go to U.S. soil to interrogate Putin critics
He specifically mentioned William Browder, who promoted the Magnitsky Act sanctions
Russian prosecutors also want to interview former U.S. ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders did not rule out the proposal at a news conference on Wednesday
'He didn't commit to anything,' she said. 'It was just an idea that they threw out'
