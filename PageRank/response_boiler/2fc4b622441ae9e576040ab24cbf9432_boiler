President Donald Trump was ridiculed on MSNBC on Tuesday over his insecurity over the size of things he views as representative of his manhood.
“The most powerful man in the world has always seemed like one of the most insecure,” said Chris Hayes, host of “All In.”
He played a cringe-inducing 2016 clip of Trump discussing his hand size.
“Look at those hands, are they small hands?” Trump asked. “If they’re small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there’s no problem — I guarantee you.”
Hayes then broke down how former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX) drew a bigger crowd in El Paso, TX.
The host then gave example after example of Trump trying to exaggerate the size of things.
