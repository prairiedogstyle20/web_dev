President Donald Trump’s top disaster official reportedly said on Wednesday that he is quitting the job.
Federal Emergency Manager Agency administrator Brock Long said that it was time for him to “go home,” according to Bloomberg reporter Jennifer Jacobs.
“While this has been the opportunity of the lifetime, it is time for me to go home to my family – my beautiful wife and two incredible boys,” Long’s statement explained “Upon my departure, Mr. Peter Gaynor, will serve as Acting FEMA administrator.”
Long came under fire during his tenure at the agency after he was accused of improperly using government vehicles.
