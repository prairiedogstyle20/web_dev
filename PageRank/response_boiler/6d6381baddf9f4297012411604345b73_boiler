It's now on President Donald Trump to keep the federal government open, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warned Tuesday, pleading for the disruptor-in-chief to not pull the plug on Congress' new funding deal.
"No one gets everything they want in these agreements," Schumer (D-NY) said on the Senate floor. "The President must sign it, and not, not, not cause another shutdown."

Democratic and Republican negotiators announced a deal in principle Monday night that gives $1.375 billion for border security and 55 miles of fencing in Texas. It also gives Trump the flexibility to detain up to 52,000 undocumented migrants, according to Republicans. But it has no money for a concrete wall, and is far short of the funding Trump wanted.
Republicans agreed to the deal, though, because they see the new fencing and aggressive detention policy as steps forward.
If the agreement goes down, it will be because of Trump, Schumer said.
"We now have a bipartisan proposal to accomplish our goals -- better secure the border, and avoid another senseless government shutdown," Schumer said.
"We must not have a rerun of what happened a few months back where legislators, Democrat and Republican, House and Senate, agreed, and President Trump pulled the rug out from under the agreement and caused the shutdown," Schumer said.
The President said he didn’t think there will be another shutdown, but said he didn’t like what he’s been told about the deal.
"I can't say I'm happy. I can't say I'm thrilled," he said. But one way or another, he said, "the wall's getting built."
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) -- who thought he had a funding deal with the president last December only to see Trump back out -- was somewhat more cautious, but nevertheless praised the product of the conference committee that produced the new deal.
He said Democrats backed off on demands that there be no new barriers and severe cuts to detention counts.
"Fortunately, our Democratic colleagues did abandon those unreasonable positions, and the negotiations were able to move forward productively," he said. "I know I speak for members on both sides of the aisle when I say we are grateful to our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee."
"I look forward to reviewing the full text as soon as possible and hope the senate can act on this legislation in short order," McConnell added.
The full text of the agreement will likely be made public on Wednesday.
