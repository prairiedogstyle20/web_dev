Scarborough: Why Are Trump Supporters Still Chanting ‘Lock Her Up?’
12 Feb 2019
Tuesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” host Joe Scarborough reacted to President Donald Trump’s rally from the night before in El Paso, Texas.
Supporters at the rally chanted, “Lock her up” in regards to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Scarborough blasted the people chanting to lock Clinton up when multiple members of Trump’s campaign have been in legal trouble.
“The thing is, Mika, you can really understand why people are still chanting “lock her up” for Hillary Clinton,” Scarborough sarcastically said. “After all, you go back and you look at Hillary Clinton’s campaign and State Department — the most corrupt in American history. Her national security adviser, you know, pled guilty to federal charges, her campaign manager pled guilty to campaign charges, her number two in the campaign pled guilty to federal charges, you had her — oh, wait a second.”
“Yeah, I think you’re getting her mixed up,” co-host Mika Brzezinski chimed in. “That’s Donald Trump.”
“Oh, wow. About eight or nine of his associates,” Scarborough added. “I’m confused. Why are they saying, ‘Lock her up’ when everybody around Donald Trump, including his longest-serving political adviser also taken out of his house in handcuffs? The guy he told the Washington Post was one of his top foreign policy aides thrown in jail. His lawyer thrown — I’m sorry. I don’t understand who were the adults chanting, ‘Lock her up’ for Hillary Clinton because her people didn’t go to jail. All of Donald Trump’s people have gone to jail.”
