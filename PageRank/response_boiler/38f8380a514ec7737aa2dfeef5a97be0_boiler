“I have always believed and continue to believe that the United States is the greatest country in the world but our history and our policies in the Middle East have been confusing at times,” he added.
Gulf News reported that Barrack was speaking at the Milken Institute MENA Summit in Abu Dhabi when he suggested that atrocities in any country are "dictated by the rule of law," and that Western nations failed to understand the Saudi government.

“I believe that as a nation we do constantly work to lead by example, and I believe that we still do,” Barrack said in Wednesday's statement. “I apologize for not making it clear at the time that I consider the killing reprehensible.”
Saudi Arabia and its crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, have faced intense international scrutiny in the months following Khashoggi's death at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.
The Washington Post columnist and U.S. resident was an outspoken critic of Saudi leadership, and was last seen entering the consulate on Oct. 2.
The Saudi government initially denied knowledge of Khashoggi's whereabouts, and changed its story multiple times before charging more than a dozen Saudis for their alleged involvement in his murder.
U.S. and international intelligence officials have indicated that the crown prince likely played a role in Khashoggi's death.
