Now I want you to just think back to the first term of Obama when the Tea Party movement was getting underway. The media and democrats were already demonizing the Tea Party meetings by calling them racist.
Can you imagine if some people at a Tea Party meeting set up a piñata of Obama and started to beat the crap out of it like you see in this video? The media and dems would have been apoplectic!
Yet this happens to Trump and we hear NOTHING. Not a word. Prazan couldn’t have been the only media person there while Beto was speaking.
But hey, the media is fair and honest. No double standard here.
