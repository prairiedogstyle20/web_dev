President Trump  on Tuesday called on Rep.  Ilhan Omar  (D-Minn.) to resign or be barred from serving on congressional committees as punishment for her remarks on Israel that were criticized as anti-Semitic.
“Anti-Semitism has no place in the United States Congress,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House. “And I think she should either resign from Congress or she should certainly resign from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.”
Omar apologized on Monday for comments the previous day suggesting that U.S. support for the Jewish state is the result of money flowing from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), an influential pro-Israel lobbying group. In her apology she said her “intention is never to offend my constituents or Jewish Americans as a whole.”
The president said Omar’s comments are “deep seated in her heart” and called her apology “lame.”
Trump’s decision to weigh in comes at a time when Democrats are grappling with competing views on Israel within their party. Those divisions were recently highlighted by comments from Omar and Rep.  Rashida Tlaib  (D-Mich.) — the first Muslim women elected to Congress — who have both criticized the U.S.-Israel relationship.
