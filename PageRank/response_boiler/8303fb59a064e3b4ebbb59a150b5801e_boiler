In the latest US news and Trump news, a supporter of President Trump wearing a MAGA hat attacked BBC cameraman Ron Skeans at a Trump rally in El Paso Texas. President Donald Trump is famously anti-media and often feuds with CNN news and CNN reporter Jim Acosta.
Ron Skeans was violently pushed and shoved by a member of the crowd while covering a President Trump rally in Texas… The man was removed by security and Ron is fine. The president could see the incident and checked with us that all was okay. It is clearly unacceptable for any of our staff to be attacked for doing their job. — Gary O’Donoghue, BBC Washington Correspondent
Reporter Jacob Rascon captured the incident from another angle and said a fellow reporter had to restrain the Trump supporter
[Jacob Rascon clips]: You all right? Everything ok?
'This is the shameful moment when my cameraman Ron Skeans was attacked by @realDonaldTrump supporter in El Paso - after the President repeatedly goaded the crowd over supposed media bias.'
This is the latest video of a Trump supporter in a MAGA hat to make headlines. Recently a group of MAGA kids from Covington went viral for their interaction with a Native American protester.
