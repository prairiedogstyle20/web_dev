Leafs call up two goalies as Andersen put on IR
Mitch Marner was so upset about being left out of the all-star game that he went out and put his name in the Maple Leafs record book.
Marner’s goal at seven seconds against the Minnesota Wild on Thursday afternoon tied a team record for the fastest to start a game, set by Charlie Conacher in 1932, coming when Marner lifted a backhand past Devan Dubnyk.
Marner scored again before the game was six minutes old, making it clear the all-star snub didn’t quite get him ruffled.
Marner’s fifth two-goal game of his National Hockey League career helped put the Leafs in the right direction, but Toronto was unable to build and wound up losing 4-3 at Scotiabank Arena.
The pair of goals came less than 24 hours after Marner learned he would not be going to the all-star game. It’s a slight, all right, and highlights the dopey NHL rule that states each team must have one representative in the event.
Some players who go aren’t deserving, while others, such as Marner and teammates Morgan Rielly and Frederik Andersen, have earned an opportunity that they won’t get.
Marner leads the Leafs in scoring with 55 points (15 goals and 40 assists) in 40 games, was sixth overall in NHL scoring and had a league-high 32 primary assists.
“No,” Marner said when asked whether he felt slighted by not being named to the Atlantic Division side.
“Focus on here and focus on just trying to help this team win. Nothing you can do about it.”
The sliver lining, of course, is the period of rest that will come with not participating in the game, which will be played on Jan. 26 in San Jose, and that weekend’s festivities.
The Leafs’ bye week comes after the all-star break, so there will be a period of eight days between a home game against the Washington Capitals on Jan. 23 and a road game in Detroit against the Red Wings on Feb. 1.
“Definitely,” Marner said. “We’re pretty lucky so it’s seven days (without practice) to just make sure your body is feeling 100%.
“When we come back, it’s really going to be crunch time, it’s going to be the grind time and I think anyone who needs that rest, it’s going to be important.”
Still, it would have been the first all-star game for Marner, which is going to come at some point. He would have been fine with going.
“It’s always a cool event,” Marner said. “But like I said, stuff happens and not a big deal. Since the news came out, I did not think about it too much. Bigger things in the world to think about than that.”
Auston Matthews, voted by fans as captain of the Atlantic Division, and John Tavares, named to the team on Wednesday, will be going. There remains a chance for Rielly, who is the Leafs’ Last Man In candidate, with voting by fans to be completed by Jan. 10.
Matthews said he was surprised Marner won’t be taking part.
“I was, yeah,” Matthews said. “The way it’s set up, a lot of really good players get left off the list.
“In my opinion, having missed the time I did (14 games with a shoulder injury), and seeing those three guys, the way they have played — Johnny, Mitch and Mo — I think I would give up my spot for them any day of the week because they have had unbelievable seasons and they have been great for our team. It’s just the way it is sometimes and that’s the way it goes.”
Tavares will play in the game for the sixth time. Rielly, if he gets the Atlantic’s Last Man In vote, will go for the first time.
Rielly and Brent Burns of the San Jose Sharks are tied for the NHL points lead among defencemen with 44 each.
“It’s always a great honour,” Tavares said. “You know how deep this league is, how talented it is, and especially with our group, there is no question there probably should be a couple more guys who should be there, at least in my opinion. I feel very fortunate and it should be a lot of fun.”
MARNER LAMENTS LOSS
Mitch Marner lamented the one that got away.
Not the NHL all-star game, but the Maple Leafs’ game against the Minnesota Wild on Thursday afternoon.
A couple of quick strikes by Marner weren’t enough, and though the Leafs finished with 41 shots on goal, tied for the second-most they have had in a game this season, they fell 4-3.
“We could have handled the puck better,” Marner said. “We should have got the puck in more, should have held it a little longer in the O zone.
“These are things we have to learn and we have to learn quick. It’s coming down to the stretch now and this is where everybody is going to start grinding and playing that lock-down game. So we have to make sure we’re ready for that and we have to make sure we find ways to score around that.”
Marner provided the threat he always does in the offensive zone, and had nine shots on goal, tying his career personal high. In total, he had 13 shot attempts.
