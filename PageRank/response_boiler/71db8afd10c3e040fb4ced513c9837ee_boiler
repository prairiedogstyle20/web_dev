They are now applauding themselves after proposing a bill that reminds me of America in Soylent Green. Minimal transportation, no cattle except for the rich, bunch of homeless people because they ran out of "unwilling to work" money, very few are allowed out into the countryside combined with unpayable taxes so farming collapses, assisted suicide, promoting/forcing abortions for the environment.
Obviously some of those aren't in the GND but they are Dem/Socialist policies they have proposed before. I don't expect the Democrat party to be recognizable by the end of 2020, especially after they lose the landslide because only a fragment of Reddit/Twitter want socialism and everyone else is terrified/disgusted of their behavior and proposals, although we here at TD laugh it off.
