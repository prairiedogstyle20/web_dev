Trump is making socialism great again. I'm in.
Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar slammed U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday in response to his call for her to resign from the U.S. Congress.
Omar, who sparked controversy earlier this week with a tweet many viewed as anti-Semitic, wrote: "Hi @realDonaldTrump – You have trafficked in hate your whole life – against Jews, Muslims, Indigenous, immigrants, black people and more. I learned from people impacted by my words. When will you?"

Hi @realDonaldTrump -
You have trafficked in hate your whole life—against Jews, Muslims, Indigenous, immigrants, black people and more. I learned from people impacted by my words. When will you? https://t.co/EqqTyjkiNE

Trump said Tuesday that Omar’s apology for suggesting that members of Congress support Israel because they are being paid to do so was “lame” and she should resign.
In a pair of tweets over the weekend, the Minnesota representative – who is one of the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress – criticized the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. “It’s all about the Benjamins baby,” she wrote, using slang for $100 bills.

Asked on Twitter who she thought was paying members of Congress to support Israel, Omar cited the pro-Israel lobby: “AIPAC!”
Trump told reporters at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday that “anti-Semitism has no place in the United States Congress.”
