This morning Ed wrote about NBC News’ report that Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee basically agree there’s no evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump administration. That report was authored by Ken Dilanian and this morning after the story went up, he appeared on MSNBC to convey the gist of his report. Now, President Trump has tweeted out video of that report saying, “Thank you to MSNBC!”

The video opens with MSNBC’s Hallie Jackson asking, “So, Ken, what are you hearing, what are you learning?”
“Hallie, after two years and interviewing more than 200 witnesses the Senate Intelligence Committee has not uncovered any direct evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia,” Dilanian replied. He continued, “That’s according to sources on both the Republican and Democratic sides of the aisle, Hallie.”
Dilanian went on to say that Sen. Burr had made this claim last week but characterized it as a “partisan comment from one side.” But having spoken to Democrats, they “don’t dispute that characterization.”
Naturally, there are lots of people replying to this who seem eager to miss the point. For example:
Robert Mueller will show collusion.  Just wait!

The whole point of this NBC/MSNBC report was that it isn’t just coming from “the Republican Senate.” Did he not watch the clip he’s responding to? Apparently not. For true believers, no setback in this unending investigation is permanent. The proof is always just around the corner or behind the grassy knoll. It simply can’t be the case that they’ve put two years into building this up and it amounted to nothing.
