Democrats push new proposal to limit number of beds in ICE detention centers
Would this proposal create 'Catch and Release 2.0?' Reaction from former Border Patrol chief Mark Morgan.
There’s more proof that Democrats don't give a hoot about immigration, IRS tax refund checks, or anything of the sort. Why do I say that? Because they were finally making some headway on some kind of funding package to keep the government open after Friday. So what happened on Saturday? Democrats threw another monkey wrench into the machinery and are now demanding -- in exchange for any wall funding -- that they decrease the number of detainment beds available for people who cross into the country illegally.
Why would the Democrats do that?
Think about that. We plan to detain lawbreakers who broke our laws, those who came into the country illegally, and Democrats want a fewer number of detainment beds available and detainment facilities to hold these people?
DAN BONGINO: HEY, REP. OCASIO-CORTEZ, SHOW US HOW IT'S DONE AND DONATE 70 PERCENT OF YOUR INCOME TO THE GOVERNMENT
Why?
Because it's not about immigration. The Democrats are trying to propose something they know Donald Trump won't agree to because he clearly cares about enforcing our immigration laws.

So what will happen? The government will shut down again and they'll try to blame it on Trump.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Democrats don't care. This is a pure political play. Don’t kid yourself, this was never about immigration.

Democrats have been offered political compromises in the past where people who were already in the country illegally would be allowed to stay for some period of time but wouldn't be allowed to vote, and they've turned that down.
Again, this is not about immigration. It's about a pure power play and a political victory against Donald Trump.

The Democrats understand they had a disastrous week last week. The party of identity politics is now knee-deep in scandals. There is a photo of one of their governors either in blackface or a Ku Klux Klan outfit. You have the Green New Deal. They’re attacking Medicare patients, hospital workers, the airline industry, farting cows.
They desperately need to change the conversation and they need a government shutdown. -- American citizens be darned.
