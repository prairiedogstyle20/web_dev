Rest in peace, 69 jokes.
It brings me no pleasure to report that President Donald Trump included "69" and "nice" in the same tweet on Wednesday, effectively killing the internet's most beloved tradition . That's right, folks: 69 jokes will never be the same again. Blame the president.
The Gallup Poll just announced that 69% of our great citizens expect their finances to improve next year, a 16 year high. Nice!

Trump's tweet referred to a Gallup poll released earlier this week in which 69 percent of respondents said they expected their finances to improve over the next year. So the number can't be helped. But it does raise a disturbing question: Does Trump know about 69 jokes, or is this tweet simply a coincidence?
Trump made a 69 joke. Someone check on Kevin bacon? I don’t know. I don’t know anymore. Do you like this? Is this what you want? When will you people ever be happy?

Frankly, I do not wish to think about it.
