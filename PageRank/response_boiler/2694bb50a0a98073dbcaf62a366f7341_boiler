Yesterday’s NBC Nightly News show and this morning’s Today Show both conveniently ignored the network’s own exclusive report that vindicates President Trump, according to Newsbusters.
The report, from NBC News intelligence and national security reporter Ken Dilanian, describes how the Senate Intelligence Committee hasn’t found any evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. It was first reported yesterday morning on MSNBC Live.
The report cites Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who said last week that the committee doesn’t have “anything that would suggest there was collusion by the Trump campaign and Russia.”
And–much to the chagrin of liberals everywhere–the NBC story notes, “Democrats don’t dispute” Burr’s characterization.
Newsbusters writes : “Instead of reporting on their massive breaking news story that drove a flood of reporting by other outlets, NBC Nightly News and anchor Lester Holt chose to hype DNA tests for dogs. [UPDATE: NBC skipped its own reporting again on Today.]”
NBC wasn’t the only network to skip out on the breaking story. Yesterday’s ABC’s World News Tonight and the CBS Evening News also ignored the story.
ABC’s George Stephanopoulos did report on the story this morning, however, and was quite eager to point out that Democratic Senate Intelligence Committee member Sen. Mark Warner (VA) has come out and stated that he “respectfully disagrees” with the report.
As Newsbusters reminds us, the big 3 network’s response to the Senate findings isn’t much different from their reporting on the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia:
“On March 12, 2018, a similar investigation by the House Intelligence Committee was ended because they too could find no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. In that case, ABC and CBS gave  a combined total of less than one minute  (58 seconds) to those findings. NBC seems opposed to reporting any news on the Russia investigation that could vindicate Trump because they also ignored the House Intel Committee findings.”
