President Donald Trump received an approval rating jump in the week following his State of the Union address.
Rasmussen reports that the president’s approval rating  is now at 52 percent, a nine-point jump in just ten days.
Trump’s approval rating hit a low of 43 percent at the end of January, but strong jobs numbers released in February and a successful State of the Union address appear to have had an effect on his approval numbers.
The last time that Trump earned a 52 percent approval rating from Rasmussen was in March 2017.
The president plans a campaign rally for his 2020 re-election campaign in El Paso, Texas, on Monday.
