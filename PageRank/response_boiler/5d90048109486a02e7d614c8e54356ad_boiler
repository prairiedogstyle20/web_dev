Trump's use of Iranian photographer's image raises copyright concerns
The New York Times is reporting that earlier this week, Donald Trump’s tweeted photograph of a 2017 protest in Iran was without a license or the permission of the photographer, Yalda Moayeri, an Iranian photojournalist. Moayeri’s Instagram post on the issue states that “having president Trump use it without my permission in a tweet in Persian even is a great shame for me and causes me deep sorrow.” Moayeri stated that she gave the photo to AP and AFP. NPPA has not been able to independently verify that the use was unlicensed, however, a usage note on the AP Images listing  states: "This content is intended for editorial use only. For other uses, additional clearances may be required."
"Ms. Moayeri’s sentiment – that she didn’t want to be a part of what she called “Trump’s agenda against Iran” – illustrates how copyright protection for independent visual journalists is about more than just money and compensation," said NPPA attorney Alicia Wagner Calzada. "Photographers have a right to control how their work is used and to prevent it from being used in a manner that violates their principles," Calzada said, adding that the question of whether Moayeri could sue Trump under U.S. Copyright law cannot be answered without further information, because Iran is not a signatory to any of the multitude of treaties with the U.S. that relate to copyright protection, but that is not a complete barrier.
“As with so many cases involving the misappropriation of images – whether or not it is an infringement is very fact specific and often raises more questions than it does provide answers,” added NPPA general counsel Mickey H. Osterreicher.
