Donald John Trump House committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE 's approval rating rose 7 percentage points after the end of the recent 35-day partial government shutdown, a Gallup poll released early Wednesday showed.
The survey found that the president's approval rating jumped from 37 percent in mid-January during the heart of the shutdown to 44 percent in early February after he agreed to reopen the government.
The increase is largely attributable to more positive remarks among independents, pollsters found. That group's approval of Trump rose 6 percentage points from the January poll to the February poll, Gallup said.

Trump also benefited from an increase in those respondents identifying as Republican, Gallup said. Eighty-nine percent of GOP respondents approve of the president, compared to just 5 percent of Democrats, Wednesday's poll found.
Despite the improvement for Trump's approval rating, 29 percent of those surveyed said they are satisfied with the way things are going in the country, compared to 69 percent who are dissatisfied. 
The Gallup poll surveyed 1,016 adults from Feb. 1-10, and has a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
Trump triggered a shutdown that lasted through the end of December and for much of January when he demanded $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border. Democrats staunchly refused to provide money for the wall, but had offered money for other border security measures.
The president, who said last December that he would be "proud" to shutter the government for wall funding, ultimately agreed to reopen the shuttered federal agencies until Feb. 15 without securing funding for the structure. Conservatives widely criticized the move as a capitulation at the time.
A bipartisan group of lawmakers has since negotiated a border security agreement that includes $1.375 billion in funding for roughly 55 miles of new barriers along the southern border. Trump on Tuesday voiced disappointment in the deal, but indicated later that he was open to the agreement.
