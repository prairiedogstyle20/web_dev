President Trump departed Joint Base Andrews Monday afternoon and headed to El Paso, Texas for a MAGA rally.
The President will give a speech about border security just 1,000 feet from the successful border fence in El Paso.
Will be heading to El Paso very soon. Big speech on Border Security and much else tonight. Tremendous crowd! See you later!

Prior to departing Joint Base Andrews, President Trump said to the press about his rally in El Paso, “We’re going there for a reason, we’re going there to keep our country safe … without a wall, it’s not going to work.”

Meanwhile…
Well this was embarrasing. Only about 25 people showed up early to see Beto.

Beto Swag.
Saludos de El Paso, where the Beto march is going to kick off in a little more than an hour. On my way here, there were “low visibility blowing dust” signs up, and you can kind of see how windy it is because of the flag. Trump rally venue is not too far from here. pic.twitter.com/Zdgd5bwlps
