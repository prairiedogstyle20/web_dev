How far will Democrats go to defend illegal aliens?
There doesn’t seem to be a bottom.
And Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) showed that yet again on Monday when he appeared on CNN’s “Situation Room” and argued that President Donald Trump was wrongly criminalizing illegal aliens driving under the influence.
Matt Albence, the deputy director of ICE, had expressed his concern about limiting the number of beds (people) that they could have in detention centers. Albence said placing an artificial limitation number could be “extremely damaging” to public safety because it would require releasing criminals back into society if you went over the cap.
Host Wolf Blitzer asked Menendez what he thought about Albence’s remarks.
From Free Beacon:
“The reason that they are already 8,000 over their budgeted amount, so they’re violating the budget, is because of the president’s zero-tolerance policy that has turned everyone, regardless of their record, into a criminal,” Menendez said. “For example, if you cross the border undocumented, he has now made you a criminal. He is creating that problem by turning people away who legitimately seek asylum.”
“If a person has a driving while under the influence violation, he is now making that, saying that that’s a criminal,” Menendez added, before arguing that violent criminals should be “arrested” and “deported.”
According to ICE’s annual report, half of the 158,000 people arrested by ICE—80,730—were charged or convicted of driving under the influence in 2018, the Washington Examiner reported.
So let’s break that down.
He’s saying that ICE is already having to deal with 8,000 more people than they counted on in their budget.
Translation? Emergency. Problem. They should be adding more money and beds, not fewer.
No, Trump isn’t preventing anyone from legitimately applying for asylum. But if you don’t properly apply and enter illegally you’re going to be detained. And those people are not detained by ICE but by the Border Patrol. So you’re not talking about the same numbers.
Menendez is actually saying they shouldn’t consider illegal aliens who drive under the influence as criminals? That that shouldn’t count as a crime? So it should be a crime for Americans but not one for illegal aliens?
And why would he say that? Because half of the people arrested by ICE involve driving under the influence.
If you eliminate that, then all of those people are free from ICE custody and not deported. And free to DUI more and hurt Americans.
Frequently in cases where there is an American killed by an illegal alien who was driving under the influence you see prior DUIs in the past.
So Menendez would just ignore them for ICE purposes all together.
This is where Democrats want to take us.
POLL: Do you support Trump on immigration?
