Trump's Russian Interpreter May Be Subpoenaed by House Democrats for Details of Private Putin Meetings, Report Says

© Pablo Martinez Monsivais President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Helsinki, Finland, on July 16, 2018. Democrats in the House of Representatives are considering subpoenaing Donald Trump’s Russian interpreter, or the linguist’s notes from private conversations between the president and Russia’s Vladimir Putin.
Representatives in Congress plan to significantly expand their ongoing investigation into the president and his connections to Russia, according to a report from Axios . In addition to seeking to determine what was said in private talks between Trump and Putin, Democratic lawmakers plan to interview new and former witnesses, as well as look closely at the president and his family’s finances.
Trump’s private talks with Putin have been the subject of speculation and concern since the two leaders met for a Helsinki summit last summer. In January , The Washington Post reported that the president had gone to “extraordinary lengths to conceal details of his conversations” with his Russian counterpart. “U.S. officials said there is no detailed record, even in classified files, of Trump’s face-to-face interactions with the Russian leader at five locations over the past two years,” according to the Post.
After one 2017 meeting with Putin, Trump allegedly asked his interpreter for their notes and instructed them not to discuss the meeting with other administration officials. Analysts have criticized the president’s alleged actions, arguing that keeping the discussions private goes against protocol and allows the Russians to hijack the narrative.
Although Democrats in the House are expanding the scope of their probe, with at least three committees currently involved, Axios reported that they plan to leave the final conclusions on 2016 election interference to special counsel Robert Mueller’s team. Thus far, 34 people , including six close associates of Trump, have been indicted or pleaded guilty in Mueller’s investigation. Twenty-six of those caught up in the investigation are Russian nationals. Three Russian companies have also been charged.
Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who has been criminally convicted in the probe, lied about sharing confidential polling data with an associate allegedly linked to Russian intelligence. The other close Trump associates have all pleaded guilty to various charges, except for Roger Stone, who was formally indicted last month.
Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is also investigating allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, have said they have not yet seen concrete evidence to support the theory. But Democrats on the committee also said they expect new details to come to light and do not expect their final report to be favorable to the president.
According to MSNBC journalist Ken Dilanian, Democratic lawmakers said “they have uncovered facts yet to be made public, and that they hope to make Americans more fully aware of the extent to which the Russians manipulated the U.S. presidential election with the help of some Trump officials, witting or unwitting.”
Trump and Russia have consistently dismissed the investigation, with the president routinely calling it a “witch hunt.”
