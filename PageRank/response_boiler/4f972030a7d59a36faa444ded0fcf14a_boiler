Democrat Ilhan Omar of Minnesota has recently been under fire for her anti-Semetic tweets involving Israel and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a pro-Israel lobbying group. Omar has been receiving backlash from both sides of the isle. She later apologized on Monday.
Here is what she had to say ( via Twitter ):
“Anti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes,” Omar wrote on Twitter. “At the same time, I reaffirm the problematic role of lobbyists in our politics, whether it be AIPAC, the NRA or the fossil fuel industry.”
NEW POLL: Should Anti-Semitic Rep Omar resign from Congress?
But that wasn’t enough according to President Trump. Check out what he had to say:
“Anti-Semitism has no place in the United States Congress,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday. “And Congressman Omar, it’s terrible what she said and I think she should either resign from Congress or she should certainly resign from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.”
“I think she should resign from Congress frankly, but at a minimum she shouldn’t be on committees, certainly that committee,” he said.
President Trump also called her apology “lame” and stated that he thinks Omar’s comments are “deep seeded in her heart.” If this had been a Republican representative, I would imagine that they wouldn’t have a job at this point.
Watch what President Trump had to say about Omar:

This behavior from Omar isn’t new. She has a past of anti-Semitism and also has voiced support for easing tensions on ISIS. How is this woman in the United States Congress?
Check out what Business Insider had to say about the situation:
Over the weekend, Omar wrote on Twitter, “It’s all about the Benjamins baby” in response to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy threatening punishment for other statements. Omar also suggested the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) has US lawmakers on a payroll, advancing a long-standing anti-Semitic figure of speech that Jews control politics and events through money.
Pretty sickening. President Trump isn’t the only one who has spoken out against Omar. Even Democrats are condemning her comments. Check out what Chuck Schumer had to say:
Rep. Omar’s use of an anti-Semitic stereotype was offensive and irresponsible.
This kind of intolerance has no place in Congress—or anywhere in American society.
No one should invoke anti-Semitic tropes during policy disagreements.

Pretty surprising, right? Maybe Schumer should call on her to resign since “this kind of intolerance has no place in Congress.”
