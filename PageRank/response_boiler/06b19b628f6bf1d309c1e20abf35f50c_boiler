“He’s really good. People kind of forgot the things that he’s able to do out there (because he missed most of last season due to injury),” Siakam said. “It’s just fun to watch.”
Just maybe not if you’re trying to slow him down.
“When a guy (like Leonard) gets going, it’s hard to stop him,” said Jazz star Donovan Mitchell, who was held to 7-for-23 shooting.
Unable to make a shot in recent games or get a call early on, the Raptors tried something different: Eschewing the favoured three-point shot, Toronto attempted only three from beyond the arc through the game’s first 18 minutes. Meanwhile, Utah had an 18-4 free throw attempt advantage and took a 53-51 lead into the break.
Find the shooters.

Then the second half began and a completely different Toronto team emerged from the tunnel. Siakam hit consecutive three-pointers after Fred VanVleet opened with one of his own and the Raptors as a whole started to parade to the free-throw line.
Leonard most of all, as he scored at least 20 points for the 14th game in a row.
Only Serge Ibaka (20 vs. the Lakers) has scored more for the Raptors in a quarter this season and the team rode the surge to a 95-85 edge.
Raptors head coach Nick Nurse indicated that he expected a game like this to pop up.
“I think I’ve mentioned it a few times early in the year that it looks like he moves to some spaces fairly easy and he’d have some 9-for-22 (shooting lines) at the end of the night and I’d be thinking, ‘When’s he going to go 16-for-22?’ Nurse said.
“Because it looks like there are shots that are on-line and they just wouldn’t go in. Kind of been waiting for one of these nights where he makes them all He was great and he’s a special, special player, as we know.”
STOP THIS KAWHI!

Utah fought hard until the end and actually was within four points inside of the final minute, but after an Ibaka miss, Danny Green swooped in for an offensive rebound and a tough Leonard shot was rebounded by Siakam, leading to free throws and putting the game away.
Toronto got back on track ahead of two tough games (first the amped-up Spurs and DeRozan, then Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks in Milwaukee) after finishing December just a game over .500. Overall the team is 28-11.
While Green said he’s treating his return to San Antonio as “just another game,” Leonard admitted that “it’s going to be fun. Everybody’s anticipating the game (except for Green, apparently). Things like that only get me better for the long run,” Leonard said.

THE LATEST ON LOWRY
The Raptors organization casually revealed early on New Year’s Day that Kyle Lowry received “pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory injections for his back soreness” on Friday at New York’s Hospital for Special Surgery.
Lowry apparently has responded well to the treatment and coach Nurse continues to expect him to return to action in the not-too-distant future.
“I think so, yeah,” Nurse said of a Lowry return being close.
“Again, it’s now into pain management stage a little bit and he’s going out on the court here in a little bit to take some shots. Each day we’ll be monitoring him and seeing when he’s gonna be ready to go.”
Lowry missed his fourth straight game on Tuesday and his ninth in the past 10 games.
SCREENERS MISSED
Nurse said pre-game that Toronto’s offence has stalled noticeably so often over the past few weeks because Lowry and Jonas Valanciunas have been sidelined.
Not only does Lowry lead the NBA in assists, but he also scores well inside, which, of course is a Valaciunas speciality. Plus, the two longest-serving Raptors bring something else to the table.
“They’re two of our best screeners,” Nurse said.
“I know that sounds silly, Kyle as one of our best screeners (because he’s one of the smallest players on the court), but he is. They’re also just kinda high-output guys. They’re gonna get their 12 13 14 15 (points) just about every night, Kyle’s been tacking on 10 assists a night as well. So we miss that.”
The Raptors also miss the easy buckets Valanciunas produces by hitting the offensive glass and Nurse believes that Ibaka has looked less fresh without Valanciunas available to take a lot of the load off of him when they’ve been platooning.
“When Serge kinda has to do it all night long it’s a little harder for him,” Nurse said.
Ibaka and Greg Monroe had trouble containing Utah big men Rudy Gobert and Favors in the early going on Tuesday.
All Toronto can do until the duo returns though is adapt to life without them. They don’t have a choice.
“We’re getting there, we’re starting to iron some things out with these other guys, and we’ve gotta figure it out without ’em. That’s just where we are,” Nurse said.

HECK OF A MONTH
Leonard finished fourth in the NBA in scoring in December, averaging 29.1 a game, trailing only James Harden, Paul George and Anthony Davis.
Leonard became only the third Raptor to ever average 28 or more points per game in a month, joining Vince Carter and DeMar DeRozan. DeRozan did it in January of 2017, Carter on five different occasions.
Entering Tuesday, Leonard had scored at least 20 points in a career-best 13 straight games. Carter scored at least 20 points in 23 straight in 2001.
AROUND THE RIM
