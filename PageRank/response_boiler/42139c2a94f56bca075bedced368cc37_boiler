Andrew M. Cuomo was about to marry. Donald J. Trump was about to divorce. And the future governor of New York and the future president of the United States crossed paths at Mr. Cuomo’s bachelor party.
The year was 1990 and Mr. Cuomo, the son of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, was merging with the Kennedy clan — “Cuomolot,” the union was called — just as Mr. Trump was splitting with Ivana Trump in a typical tabloid spectacle.
Mr. Trump did not attend the party, but he sent a lighthearted video clip that played at the Manhattan bar where Mr. Cuomo’s friends and political luminaries had gathered.
“Whatever you do, Andrew,” Mr. Trump advised Mr. Cuomo in the video, “don’t ever, ever fool around.”
There is a lot less joking these days.
As Mr. Cuomo has made his opposition to Mr. Trump the centerpiece of his Democratic primary campaign for a third term, his verbal and legal assaults on the Republican president have drawn the two into a war of words and offered a blunt preview of what a 2020 presidential campaign featuring two political scrappers from Queens might look like, as implausible as that might seem.
Mr. Cuomo called Mr. Trump “un-American,” a “coward” and tied him to “sexism, racism, bigotry, and intolerance” in just the last week. Mr. Trump mocked Mr. Cuomo’s rumored presidential ambitions — “Please do it. Please,” he said, dripping with sarcasm — and then piled on with a half-dozen tweets after Mr. Cuomo said America “was never that great.”
The attacks and counterattacks mark the first direct confrontation between the two politicians, who rose in the shadows of their fathers, with a long and layered history that stretches back more than three decades. In a glimpse into their shared past, at one point last week Mr. Trump said Mr. Cuomo had privately promised not to run for president against him. (Mr. Cuomo, a day later, denied this.)
“Mr. Trump, I’ve known you for 30 years,” Mr. Cuomo told a mostly black audience in a Brooklyn church on Sunday. “You may be a slick salesman who fooled many people in this country. But you didn’t fool me.”
Mr. Cuomo declined to be interviewed for this article, and the White House did not respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo played down Mr. Trump’s taped appearance at Mr. Cuomo’s bachelor party, saying it was “one of 20 cameos” in a “spoof video montage.”
By no means are Mr. Trump, 72, and Mr. Cuomo, 60, friends, and they have never been particularly close, people who know them say.
But in the transactional worlds of politics and real estate, the lives of the two men have often intersected. It’s an only-in-New York tale of power, ambition, influence, fame, feuding and, of course, money.
A Big Donor
The story begins in a corner store deli.
That is the place that, more than a half-century ago, Fred Trump, the president’s father, frequented as he built homes near Jamaica, Queens, according to Tim O’Brien, who wrote a biography of Donald Trump. The grocery store belonged to Andrea Cuomo, Mr. Cuomo’s grandfather.
When Mario Cuomo later graduated from law school and joined his first law firm, in 1958, one of the partners and his mentor, Richard Charles, had already been representing Fred Trump for years. Mario worked on the account, too, according to Wayne Barrett’s biography, “Trump: The Deals and the Downfall.”

By the 1980s, when Mario Cuomo became governor, Donald Trump was a swashbuckling developer and one of New York’s biggest political donors, a man known for leaning on his connections to try to bend government to his company’s needs.
“He played the game,” Roger Stone, a longtime confidant, recalled of Mr. Trump’s pursuit of the Cuomos.
Among Mr. Trump’s moves was hiring a law firm run by close Cuomo associates as he sought to, among other things, build a sports stadium in Queens. Andrew Cuomo, then in his 20s, was a rising-star adviser to his father who had managed his campaigns and would later become partner in the law firm when Mr. Trump was still a client.
When news of the hiring went public, Mr. Trump said the firm was representing him “in a very significant transaction.”
The arrangement stirred some controversy , with some commenters suggesting that Mr. Trump hired the firm to curry favor with Mario Cuomo.
Andrew Cuomo called questions of influence peddling “the cheapest shot you can take at me” because he said he was not doing anything related to state government.
By 1989, Mr. Trump was Mario Cuomo’s largest corporate donor, according to Mr. Barrett’s biography, and the two appeared together in public, like when the governor celebrated the “Tour de Trump” bicycle race in Albany.
That day, Mario Cuomo told an autograph-seeking child that he needed “two things” to run for office: “a makeup kit and a conversation with Donald Trump about how to get in the newspapers.”
Those around Mario Cuomo said he did not much care for Mr. Trump.
“Trump is exactly the kind of guy Mario hated: all fluff and no substance,” said Bill Eimicke, who served as Mario Cuomo’s housing czar.
But Mr. Trump was also a big donor, and the Cuomos kept him close.
Mr. Trump donated $10,000 to a charity fund-raiser in 1989 that benefited Andrew Cuomo’s homeless nonprofit.
Mr. Cuomo’s spokeswoman, Dani Lever, said the governor had not solicited the donation to what was a joint gala with another nonprofit.
Mr. Trump also stopped by a birthday party for Andrew Cuomo that year where, according to Mr. Barrett’s book, they were seen huddling for a half-hour.
Just days earlier, Mr. Trump had purchased the priciest table at a Mario Cuomo fund-raiser.
Years later, Andrew Cuomo would retell an anecdote of running into Mr. Trump at a social function in New York, according to a person who heard it directly from Mr. Cuomo.

Mr. Trump told Mr. Cuomo he wanted to show him “something incredible” and walked him over to his limousine. Mr. Cuomo, a car fan, thought it would be some kind of new auto gadget. Mr. Trump opened the door and there was Marla Maples, eventually Mr. Trump’s second wife.
“How amazing is this?” Mr. Trump said to Mr. Cuomo, who made some small talk before he sought to quickly excuse himself. (The governor’s office did not dispute the anecdote.)
‘Sometimes You Have to Hold a Grudge’
By the mid-1990s, Mario Cuomo was out of office and Andrew Cuomo was the one in power as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. Trump wanted what he described in one of his books as “a perfectly legal and appropriate favor” from Andrew Cuomo.
So he called the elder Mr. Cuomo, who said he would not help Mr. Trump get to his son.
“You can go to hell!” Mr. Trump yelled at Mario Cuomo, according to his book.
“For years I’ve helped you and never asked for a thing, and when I finally need something, and a totally proper thing at that, you aren’t there for me. You’re no good,” Mr. Trump went on.
The title of the chapter is “Sometimes You Have to Hold a Grudge.”
There was more to it than that, recalled Howard Glaser , who was then the acting general counsel of the federal housing department.
The younger Mr. Cuomo had told him of Mr. Trump’s tirade and threats at the time.
Mr. Glaser recalled that Mr. Trump had threatened to pull all his business from Mario Cuomo’s law firm, Willkie Farr & Gallagher, if Andrew Cuomo did not approve a roughly $350 million loan guarantee for Mr. Trump’s Riverside South project in Manhattan.
“We became aware of it when the secretary conveyed this threat that had occurred to his father and his instruction to us was to just follow the law,” Mr. Glaser said.
The department rejected the loan.
If Mr. Trump held a grudge, it had dissipated by 2001 when he began to donate to Andrew Cuomo’s unsuccessful 2002 bid for governor, the first of a total of $64,000 that he would give to Mr. Cuomo over the course of three campaigns. (Mr. Cuomo’s current primary challenger, Cynthia Nixon, has called on the governor to return the money. He has declined.)
By 2003, Mr. Cuomo’s marriage ended in a divorce that had spilled into the gossip pages of the tabloids, just as Mr. Trump’s had more than a dozen years earlier. At one point, a lawyer for Mr. Cuomo, who is known for dictating his own statements to the news media, accused his wife of having “betrayed” him.
The always-available-for-a-quote Mr. Trump told The New York Post it was “a terrible statement” and said of Mr. Cuomo, “He really seems to be taking it very hard. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a statement like that from somebody.”
What happened next is in some dispute.
Mr. Trump was said to have called Mr. Cuomo and offered him private advice for how to navigate such a public divorce, according to a person who was told about the call at the time. Ms. Lever, Mr. Cuomo’s spokeswoman, said “that call never happened.”
‘Genuine Affection’
Mr. Trump, then a Democrat, would donate to Mr. Cuomo’s successful 2006 campaign for attorney general and again to his 2010 campaign for governor. They also had some interactions in office.

Mr. Trump wanted to build “Trump on the Ocean,” a development at Jones Beach on Long Island, which had been the subject of protests, state review, a lawsuit and eventually settlement talks with Mr. Cuomo. The project was abandoned after Hurricane Sandy. “He was O.K.,” Mr. Trump said, years later during a campaign appearance in New Hampshire, about working with Mr. Cuomo on the project.
By 2013, Mr. Trump was discussing starting his own political career, as a Republican, by challenging Mr. Cuomo for governor in 2014. Two Trump advisers at the time, Michael Caputo and Sam Nunberg, recalled that Mr. Trump seemed to personally like Mr. Cuomo, even if he disagreed with his politics.
“It was clear that Donald Trump the businessman considered Andrew Cuomo a friend,” said Mr. Caputo, describing a “genuine affection.” (Mr. Stone, a third adviser, recalled that Mr. Trump had a generally “low opinion” of Mr. Cuomo.)
Notably, while Mr. Trump has for years thrashed New York Democrats on Twitter — Eliot Spitzer, Anthony D. Weiner, Eric T. Schneiderman, Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Chuck Schumer, among them — he has hardly unleashed on Mr. Cuomo until recent days. (The cable-obsessed Mr. Trump tweeted more often about Chris Cuomo, the CNN host and Mr. Cuomo’s younger brother.)
In 2016, Mr. Cuomo campaigned vocally for Hillary Clinton, though he and Mr. Trump crossed paths at a Sept. 11 memorial event, where cameras caught them chatting. “We get along very well,” Mr. Trump explained in a radio interview that week.
Trump ‘Knows New York’
They spoke again the day after Mr. Trump’s victory over Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Cuomo said that day that Mr. Trump’s election could prove a “bonus.” “He knows New York, he knows the challenges,” Mr. Cuomo said .
They met in person at Trump Tower shortly before the president’s inauguration, a meeting Mr. Cuomo, who was pressing for federal support for infrastructure projects, described as “not adversarial.”
Asked in the lobby afterward if they had “chewed the fat” like two guys from Queens, Mr. Cuomo replied, “Maybe two people with Queens accents, but we never chewed the fat.”
Mr. Trump alluded to another private call last week, when he said Mr. Cuomo had pledged, “I’ll never run for president against you.” Mr. Trump had recounted the same private commitment from Mr. Cuomo about a year earlier, according to a person who heard it directly from him.
The governor told reporters the next day, “I don’t have any personal political conversations” with the president.
For the first six months of Mr. Trump’s presidency, Mr. Cuomo had tactically avoided antagonizing the president by name , though he was outspoken in opposition to his policies.
For a governor who has leveraged tactical détentes with Republicans before — including New Jersey’s former governor, Chris Christie, and Republicans in the New York State Senate — the idea of a pre-emptive political cease-fire with Mr. Trump to gain advantage for New York is not hard to fathom.
But times have changed for Mr. Cuomo in the run-up to next month’s primary. His office is now repackaging the governor’s most caustic tweets as news releases.
“I think this president is discordant with America,” Mr. Cuomo said on Sunday. “I believe this president is un-American.”

An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the year in which Andrew M. Cuomo and Donald J. Trump appeared at a Sept. 11 ceremony. It was 2016, not 2011.
