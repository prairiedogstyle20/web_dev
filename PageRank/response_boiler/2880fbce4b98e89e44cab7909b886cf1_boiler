Hillary Clinton already kicked Donald Trump’s butt once, getting three million more votes than he did, even as Trump committed treason by conspiring with Russia to rig certain key swing states in his favor so he could cheat his way into the Oval Office. Now that Trump has turned out to be the biggest disaster in the history of the U.S. presidency, and he’s eventually on his way to prison, she’s looking to help finish him off.
Donald Trump and his criminal regime carried out one of their most symbolically corrupt and inept moves yet when they decided to simply rip off Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign slogan. Her slogan was famously “Stronger together” but now Trump has decided that his new slogan is “We’re only getting stronger together.”
After the GOP posted Trump’s newly stolen slogan to its Twitter account, Hillary fired back accordingly, tweeting “Now copy my plan on health care, a fairer tax system, and voting rights.” She also included a link to the “issues” page on her 2016 campaign website.
Now that Donald Trump is resorting to simply copying Hillary Clinton’s slogans, perhaps she can use this to her advantage. For instance, if she starts posting “Trump for prison” on her Twitter account, it can’t be much longer before Donald Trump steals that slogan and begins tweeting “Trump for prison” as well.
