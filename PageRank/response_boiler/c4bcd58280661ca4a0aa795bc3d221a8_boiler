As much as Democrats were appalled by Ilhan Omar’s very bad tweets , the outrage cycle was hijacked by the staggering chutzpah of Donald Trump . “Trump calling on a member to resign for having said offensive things—that is beyond parody,” a Democratic House aide told me Tuesday, shortly after the president said Omar should call it quits over a series of controversial social-media posts that were widely criticized as anti-Semitic. “This is a president who said neo-Nazis were ‘very fine people’ and stood by Steve King’s bigotry,” said a senior staffer to a Democrat on the committee. “There’s no reason anyone should take him seriously when it comes to denouncing hate.”
Omar, a hijabi Muslim who has been fiercely critical of Israel, was already a prime target for the right after a 2012 tweet surfaced, in which Omar said, “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.” The Minnesota congresswoman apologized last month, but set off the anti-Semitism tripwire again on Sunday when she invoked the late-90s hip-hop anthem “It’s All About the Benjamins” to imply that pro-Israel members of Congress are beholden to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the powerful pro-Israel lobbying group. This time, the outcry wasn’t just from the right: Democratic leadership issued a swift and stinging rebuke, condemning Omar’s use of “anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel’s supporters” as “deeply offensive.” On Monday afternoon, Omar issued a statement in which she “unequivocally” apologized, even as she reaffirmed the “problematic role of lobbyists in our politics.”
Largely satisfied with Omar’s mea culpa, Democrats want to forgive and forget. “It was a mistake. She apologized,” explained the Democratic aide. “Some people were more satisfied with her apology than others. But we can’t waste days and weeks on this, because this is totally going to distract us from our agenda if we get hung up on this infighting.” The tweet about AIPAC, this person said, was “obviously a big self-inflicted wound, but we are not going to now look at the Republicans moving the goalposts and be responsive to them.”
Republicans, however, aren’t ready to move on. Aboard Air Force One on Monday evening, Trump told reporters that Omar should “be ashamed of herself.” In the White House the following day, the president upped the ante. “It’s terrible what she said, and I think she should either resign from Congress, or she should certainly resign from the House Foreign Affairs Committee,” Trump said. On Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence followed his boss’s lead and called on Omar to resign. “At minimum,” he said, “Democratic leaders should remove her from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.”
House Democratic leaders are not entertaining either idea. “Ridiculous,” a spokesperson for Nancy Pelosi told me Tuesday night. But after Trump helped paint the G.O.P. as the party of bigotry, Republicans seem eager to take a scalp of their own—and drive a wedge through the Democratic ranks by turning some of the party’s new rising stars into potent symbols of left-wing radicalism. “Crazy to watch what House Dems are empowering/elevating,” Congressman Lee Zeldin, who also sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote on Twitter last month, taking aim at Omar. They have also targeted Michigan Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian-American, who is also critical of Israel and, like Omar, supports the Palestinian-led B.D.S. movement, which Republicans have characterized as anti-Semitic. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Paul Ryan’s successor, has called on Pelosi to “take action” against Tlaib and Omar, equating their policy views on Israel to Steve King’s support for white supremacy.
“McCarthy and Lee Zeldin have been trying to stir the pot for a couple of weeks,” the Democratic aide told me. “We haven’t really taken the bait.” Party insiders are particularly irritated given Trump’s own long history of trafficking in anti-Semitic tropes. While speaking at a forum hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition in December 2015, Trump said, “You’re not going to support me because I don’t want your money . . . You want to control your own politician.” In 2016, at the height of the presidential campaign, Trump—whose daughter, Ivanka, and grandchildren are Jewish— tweeted an illustration of Hillary Clinton surrounded by hundred-dollar bills and a Star of David shape with the words “most corrupt candidate ever!” McCarthy’s hands aren’t clean either: in a since-deleted tweet from last October, the California congressman suggested that three Jewish billionaires— George Soros , Tom Steyer , and Michael Bloomberg—were trying to “buy” the midterm elections.
“That is the exact same anti-Semitic trope that members denounced Congresswoman Omar for, and Kevin McCarthy has the nerve to say that trafficking in anti-Semitic tropes is all of a sudden unacceptable,” the Democratic aide said. “This is what their party has become. It is has become a den of conspiracy theorists and bigots and anti-Semites, or at least a place where anti-Semitic notions are not condemned and are given fertile ground.” Omar’s tweet crossed a line, Democrats say, but at least she apologized.
Whether Republicans can accept that apology, too, remains to be seen. As partisanship deepens, both Republicans and Democrats are increasingly responding to racial and sexual issues in their own caucus by invoking the misdeeds of their colleagues across the aisle rather adjudicating them individually, on a moral level. It’s not clarifying to compare Ilhan’s comments to Trump’s “both sides” equivocation, just as it’s unfair to compare Ralph Northam and Justin Fairfax. What’s lost in it all, however, is that in our fast-twitch world we can no longer judge these instances are their own. Instead, they are considered as misdeeds along a sliding scale or spectrum, with varying political consequences.
Omar, for one, says she wants to do better. Can Republicans take her at her word?
“No one is perfect, but what we’ve seen is that many in the right wing have zeroed in on Reps. Omar and Tlaib, as they’ve done women of color across the board, in an attempt to silence them and delegitimize their thoughts and stances,” Denzel McCampbell, Tlaib’s communications director, told me. “Both Reps. Omar and Tlaib have shown a great willingness to listen to their critics and grow from these experiences, because they are genuinely committed to mutual respect and understanding, something that other members must be willing to do as well—and something we have yet to see from many.”
Even so, Omar is on thin ice with her colleagues. “We hope that Representative Omar will learn from this moment,” the senior staffer told me. “Her position is not consistent with the rest of the Democrats on the committee.”
