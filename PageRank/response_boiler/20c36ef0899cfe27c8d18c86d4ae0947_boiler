Eustacio Gregorio-Meza, 40, an          alleged illegal alien from Mexico, has been  arrested for          the May 14, 2017 killing  of Kenneth Scott Mahr, 18, of Palm Beach          Gardens, Florida.

Mahr is survived by his parents,          Joshua and Jennifer Walter, and several siblings.

Killed by
Raul Silva Corona, 42
Illegal alien Raul Silva Corona,  was          determined to be criminally responsible for the May 12, 2014 death of Mesa Arizona          Peace Officer Brandon Mendoza, 32.  
Corona was drunk and driving  the wrong-way on an Arizona freeway when he slammed into officer          Mendoza's vehicle.  The impact killed Corona and officer Mendoza, a          13-year veteran of the Mesa Police Department.
The Mesa Police Department          posthumously promoted Mendosa to the rank of sergeant.
Sergeant Mendoza is survived by his parents, siblings, and nieces and nephews.  He is remembered by          those who knew him as a good          police officer whom was also a valued friend and community volunteer.
OJJPAC note:  I  met Brandon's mother in Washington D.C. in          the fall of 2015.  We walked the halls of congressional offices          advocating for congressional support for the enforcement of U.S.          immigration laws so more innocent Americans are not killed. Too many          members of the U.S. Congress continue to oppose immigration law          enforcement.

Allegedly killed by
Esteban J. Tomas, 33
Illegal alien Esteban J. Tomas, 33,          is wanted in the fatal early morning New Year's day crash that killed          LaDonna "Jeannie" Brady, 45. Authorities allege that Thomas was driving          drunk and drove his  SUV in the wrong direction on Interstate 74,          causing the fatal collision with Ms. Brady's Chevrolet Equinox.
A delay  in arresting Thomas          allowed him to escape justice after he was released from the hospital          for his crash related injuries.
Tomas, now a fugitive from          justice, is reportedly is a citizen of Guatemala, and has a number of          alias, including Estaban Tomas Jurarez, Estaban Juarez-Tomas, Victor          Ochoa, and Estaban Juarez Tomas.  was living  illegally in          Urbana, Illinois.
Fugitive Tomas is charged with one          counts of aggravated driving under the influence of alcohol and one          count of driving without a license by the Campaign County State's          Attorney Julia Rietz.
Ms. Brady was born in Springfield,          IL on March 1, 1971.  She is survived by her parents, husband Eric,          children, siblings, and many other family members and friends.  Ms.          Brady was a productive citizen, worked at the Christie Clinic, and was a          valued community member.  She was a strong supporter of the          American Legion and described as "an amazing woman, mother, wife, and          friend."
OJJPAC note:  Another          outrageous incident in which city and county sanctuary policies enacted          by Illinois' elected and appointed public officials (including law          enforcement heads) likely resulted in this alleged criminal illegal          alien's ability to remain illegally in the U.S. as well as escape          justice.

Alejandro Ramirez-Jaramillo,          26
Illegal alien Alejandro Ramirez-Jaramillo, 26,          had been arrested for causing the March 26, 2017  motor vehicle          accident which resulted in the death of Robin Shellhammer, 60, his wife,          and daughter.  Three other people were also injured in the crash          that reportedly happened on North Cousino Road in Jerusalem Township,          Ohio.
Jaramillo's passengers, Javier          Cervera, 38 and Pedro Martinez [of          unknown legal status in the U.S.] were two of the injured who were transported to          local hospitals. 
Jaramillo told authorities that  he lived in Asheboro, N.C. and did construction work.
 Jaramillo has been charged          with three counts of aggravated vehicle homicide and Judge Jeffery          Keller set Jaramillo's bond at $100,000 per count.  Through an          interpreter, Jaramillo pleaded not guilty in Oregon Municipal Court and          remains in the Lucas County jail.
OJJPAC note:  This is the first Ohio          family member killed during President Trump's administration.  It          emphasizes the need for the federal government to remove ALL identified          illegal aliens from the U.S.   If Jaramillo had been deported          by Obama or Trump, the members of the Shelhammer family would still be          alive today.  Although the Trump administration has done more than          the Obama administration, it is still coming up short and needs to          fulfill its promises made during the campaign.
