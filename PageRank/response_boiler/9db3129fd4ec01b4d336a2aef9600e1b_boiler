Northwestern ’s highest-rated player kept the lowest profile on the team last fall.
Hunter Johnson, the quarterback who entered college with more acclaim than Tua Tagovailoa , served on the Wildcats scout team. One week he would mimic the skill set of Notre Dame ’s Ian Book; the next week, Iowa ’s Nate Stanley.
Johnson transferred to Northwestern from Clemson in March, releasing a five-sentence statement that concluded with “Go Cats!”
He declined interview requests at the suggestion of NU coach Pat Fitzgerald, who thought it best that the active players receive the limelight. Johnson said he was grateful for that.
As Johnson’s brother Cole put it: “You’re going to learn this about him: He doesn’t love the light on him.”
One NU staffer said he heard Johnson utter just three things at practice over the entire season: “Sorry,” “Thank you” and “My bad.”
“He’s not  going to be the loudest guy in the room,” said Clayton Thorson, Northwestern’s starting quarterback the last four seasons. “He’s really humble. But he’s confident in his abilities.”
That came across during Johnson’s 50-minute interview with the Tribune on Thursday in his preferred terrain: the quarterbacks meeting room at  the Walter Athletics Center. Johnson  often goes there, alone, to watch film and diagram plays.
Asked if he thinks he could have beaten out Trevor Lawrence had  he stayed at Clemson, Johnson replied: “I think I could have, yes.”
Lawrence threw for a combined 674 yards with six touchdowns and no interceptions in the Tigers’ playoff demolitions of Notre Dame and Alabama. He emerged as the best player in college football.
Confident in his abilities, indeed.
Here are 18 more things to know about Johnson:
1. His skills are elite.
There’s a reason he was the No. 2 quarterback in 247Sports.com’s Class of 2017 composite rankings,  ahead of Tagovailoa (Alabama), Jake Fromm (Georgia) and Tate Martell (Miami, after transferring from Ohio State ) and behind Stanford’s Davis Mills.
Bleacher Report rated  Johnson the top passer at the 2016 Elite 11 Camp, saying he “throws the prettiest spirals” and citing counselors who said he’s “most likely to succeed in any offensive scheme.”
“He spins it really well,” Thorson said. “He can throw on the run, he’s really athletic. I think the offense will be wide open.”
The 6-foot-2, 208-pound Johnson could thread a ball through a tire — maybe even the spokes of a bike tire.
“His thing is accuracy for sure,”  older brother Cole said. “From the time he could walk, this kid could throw a football. We used to throw in the pool out back. Outside the pool … across the pool … hit the diving board. It was an inch thick and he would nail it. He’d do weird stuff like that all the time.”
2. He initially committed to Tennessee.
Then-Volunteers coach Butch Jones was the first to offer a scholarship after Johnson’s freshman season at Brownsburg High School, 25 minutes  west of Indianapolis. Part of the strategy in verbally committing was to ward off other schools because Johnson, ever polite, was spending hours each week returning phone calls from college coaches.
The head coaches he got to know best during his recruitment were Jones, Fitzgerald, Penn State’s James Franklin, then-Indiana coach Kevin Wilson and Clemson’s Dabo Swinney . And he had a memorable interaction with Michigan ’s Jim Harbaugh.

3. Harbaugh made a “funny” first impression.
Johnson met Harbaugh outside his office.
“I honestly didn’t recognize him at first because he kind of looked like he just rolled out of bed,” Johnson said. “His hair was all over the place. He said, ‘Hold on, let me get fired up real quick.’ He went back and put his khakis and hat on.”
Harbaugh showed Johnson items, including a rocking chair, from the coach’s favorite restaurant, Cracker Barrel. (“You cannot beat the bacon,” Harbaugh told the San Jose Mercury News.)
Later they went out for pizza, and when the hostess was slow to find a table, Harbaugh took over.
“He was getting a little impatient, so he said, ‘I’m going to get this straightened out,’ ” Johnson recalled. “He went in the back and we got on the patio. The pizza took forever to get there, so he was getting even more frustrated. It was funny.”
4. He was at Ryan Field for the 2013 “College GameDay” loss to Ohio State.
Northwestern was recruiting Cole Johnson, who’s four years older than Hunter. Hunter recalled that Trevor Siemian and Kain Colter were a “fun duo to watch. You don’t normally get quarterbacks that complement each other that well.”
5. Northwestern made a push in recruiting.
Fitzgerald tried to sell Hunter on the chance to play with his brother, a preferred walk-on who  appeared in  six games on special teams for the Wildcats. But Hunter said: “I felt this was my brother’s school, his deal. I didn’t want to take away from him or him (potentially) earning a scholarship. The school was a perfect fit for him with how intelligent he is.”
Cole double majored in biological sciences and communication sciences and is in dental school at Indiana University .
Plus Hunter had the likes of Alabama, Notre Dame, Oklahoma and Clemson pursuing him.
“Every football player,” he said, “has aspirations to play on the biggest stage.”
6. Clemson won him over.
The Tigers were 13-0 when Johnson, a high school junior, visited in December  2015. The magnificent Deshaun Watson would play one more season. Receiver Hunter Renfrow hosted  Johnson.
“We went back to his house, played video games, watched a movie, ordered pizza and hung out,” Johnson recalled. “It was perfect for me to be around him and (defensive tackle) Christian Wilkins — great people. The small-town feel of Clemson is very special. I got a ton of one-on-one time with Coach Swinney and the coaches. I felt they were very genuine and real — and they are.”
7. He still loves Clemson.
Some of his best friends remain students (non-athletes) there. “It was tough leaving those guys,” he said. “I love them to death.”
Lawrence signed with Clemson on Dec. 20, 2017. He was the No. 1 prospect in his class, and he didn’t come to be an apprentice.
During the 2017 season, Johnson backed up Kelly Bryant and completed 21 of 27 passes for 234 yards with two touchdowns and one interception. He posted the highest passing efficiency rating of Clemson’s three quarterbacks but also knew this:  There’s only one starting quarterback.
“I saw it as both of us were too good not to at least split time,” Johnson said of him and Lawrence. “And I wanted to be somewhere I knew I’d have an opportunity to be the guy and take control. It was a sticky situation, but it’s a blessing in disguise that it got me here.”
8. He considered transferring to three schools.
Home-state Indiana and Purdue pursued, as did programs such as Ohio State. But Johnson chose Northwestern mainly because of geography (his family lives less than  three and a half hours away) and  the coaching staff.
Although Cole played sparingly at Northwestern, he raved about Fitzgerald  and Co.: “The experience is second to none. I have no critique or downers about that program. Those coaches are true to their word. It’s somewhere I’d want my kids to go.”
This is where I’m supposed to be. I miss those (Clemson) guys and love them. But I wanted to be in a spot where my family can come and watch every weekend. — Hunter Johnson
Or his baby brother.
“This is where I’m supposed to be,” Hunter said. “Don’t get me wrong. I miss those (Clemson) guys and love them. But I wanted to be in a spot where my family can come and watch every weekend.
“And the camaraderie within the team is unlike anything I’ve been around. Everyone in the locker room treats everyone the same. There’s no one guy who does his own thing. Everyone is a part of it, which is really, really neat.”
9. He is not yet Northwestern’s starting quarterback.
Thorson is off to the pros after he recuperates from a high ankle sprain suffered late in the Holiday Bowl . The Wildcats have five quarterbacks on the roster, but only brainy backup TJ Green has thrown a  pass in a game.
“It’s a competition,” offensive coordinator Mick McCall said. “There is nothing decided.” True. Also true: Andrew Marty, Aidan Smith and Jason Whittaker might be sacrificing potential playing time at another school to earn a Northwestern degree.
10. His dad could sling it.
Reed Johnson played football and pitched at the University of Evansville . Former teammates told Cole  his dad could throw it 70 yards. Reed coached his sons in football, basketball and baseball.
“He taught me to have fun with sports,” Hunter said, “but at the same time, he was great about pushing me to do those (summer passing) camps and chase after it. He would do anything for me. Sometimes we butted heads a little because we’re so similar and competitive.”
Reed  has a dentistry practice in Plainfield, Ind.  Cole said of his coaching style: “He was intense, not mean or crazy. He didn’t yell at all. It’s similar to (Celtics coach) Brad Stevens’ demeanor — and Hunter’s. Calm and level-headed.”
11. He received media training from his mom.
Shana Kelley (her maiden name) worked as a news anchor for WISH-Channel 8 in Indianapolis until 2006.  “She didn’t want to miss me and my brother growing up,” Hunter said. “She had a lot of late shifts, so we’d stay up all through the night for her to get home.”
12. Don’t bother trying to @ him.
Johnson  has no social media presence. He quit Twitter after high school and Instagram  after his first year at Clemson, saying: “I felt like I was spending time on it for no reason. I was sitting there for hours scrolling through stuff. I wasn’t one to post a lot in the first place, so that made it easier.”
He emails only for school purposes, preferring to text and FaceTime with friends.
“We are probably the least tech-savvy family in America,” Cole said.
13. The timing is perfect for Northwestern.
The Wildcats, who open spring practice Feb. 26, get a mature quarterback who turns 21 in March and has three seasons of eligibility.  Johnson has some playing experience, having faced four FBS opponents at Clemson, and he spent last season learning the NU system and Big Ten defenses. And Thorson’s four-year playing tenure was uninterrupted.
14. He and Thorson are “woven from the same cloth.”
That’s how Cole put it, adding: “They’re very deep in their (Christian) faith. Both are great guys, and when you meet ’em, they’re as laid-back as they can be. But both have this switch, this fierceness and intensity you see in the great ones.”
15. The NU offense will go back to the future.
Thorson rushed for nine touchdowns last season. That’s a lot. He also netted minus-110 yards. That’s a lot of backward, thanks to the NCAA including sacks in rushing stats. Thorson was a solid scrambler, especially considering he did it last year on a rebuilt right knee. But he didn’t supply the same threat as previous NU quarterbacks Dan Persa, Mike Kafka, C.J. Bacher, Brett Basanez and Zak Kustok.
“He’s got the ability to create space, whether it’s a scramble or designed run or option,” McCall said of Johnson. “We will go back to some of the stuff we did; we’ll go back in the archives to see what fits him and what kind of personnel is best.”
Johnson believes he has sub-4.6 speed, and he ran on Brownsburg’s  1,600-meter relay team, making Indiana’s all-state track team.
“I’ve always been able to run a little bit,” he said. “That’s part of what makes football  fun, being able to scramble around and make plays, backyard ball.”
16. He knows Drew Brees likes Chinese food.
Brees and Aaron Rodgers are Johnson’s two favorite NFL quarterbacks. So you can imagine his reaction when he spotted Brees behind him in line at a Panda Express at an airport in California.
“I said, ‘Hey, you don’t know me but I’m a quarterback and a huge fan,’ ” Johnson recalled.
They chatted about their Indiana  connection — Brees played at Purdue — but Johnson did not ask for his digits: “I didn’t want to push it. I didn’t want to be that guy.”
17. His brother has faith.
“With Fromm and Tua, Hunter is the forgotten guy in that class,” Cole said. “He is the dark  knight. And I’m not sure he won’t be the highest drafted. I’m his brother. That’s my prediction.”
18. Thorson says the NU offense is in good hands.
“Hopefully we go to the natty,” he said in December with a smile. As in national championship game.
