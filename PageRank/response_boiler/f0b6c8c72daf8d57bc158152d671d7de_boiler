President Donald Trump turned up the pressure on Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar Tuesday, demanding the first-term lawmaker resign over her Twitter comments that many of her own colleagues called anti-Semitic.
‘I think she should either resign from congress or she should certainly resign from the House Foreign Affairs Committee,’ Trump said – stoking a controversy that prompted senior Democrats and party leaders blasting Omar’s comments about Israel.
Speaking at the top of a meeting with his cabinet, Trump said Omar’s comments were  ‘deep seeded in her heart.’ He also called her apology, issued Monday after the entire Democratic leadership issued a statement condemning her comments, ‘lame.’
President Donald Trump called on Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar to resign, and called her apology ‘lame’
Omar apologized ‘unequivocally,’ she said. But she added: ‘At the same time, I reaffirm the problematic role lobbyists in our politics, whether it be AIPAC, the NRA or the fossil fuel industry.’
One of the tweets that drew criticism was her one word tweet: ‘AIPAC!’ which referenced the powerful American Israel PAC. She also tweeted ‘all about the Benjamins’ – in comments colleagues said made it seem Israel supporters adopted their positions for cash.
Trump also weighed in on the controversy swirling around Rep. Ilhan Omar Monday night, saying the first-term lawmaker ‘should be ashamed of herself’ for her ‘all about the Benjamins’ comment.
‘I think she should be ashamed of herself. I think it was a terrible statement. And I don’t think her apology was adequate, the president told reporters aboard Air Force Once en route to a Texas campaign rally.
Trump spoke hours after the lawmaker apologized facing a flood of criticism, following a flood of criticism from both Republicans and Democrats in Congress, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Asked what Ilhan should she say, Trump responded: ‘She knows what to say,’ without commenting further. It was the only part of a discussion with reporters the White House allowed on record – reflecting the political potency of the clash and Trump’s desire to weigh in.
Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, apologized for using old anti-Semitic tropes about Jews and money in recent tweets – a move that comes after a phone call with Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a statement from the entire party leadership team blasting the freshman lawmaker.
‘Anti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes,’ Omar said in a statement Monday afternoon.
‘My intention is never to offend my constituents or Jewish Americans as a whole,’ she added. ‘We have to always be willing to step back and think through criticism, just as I expect people to hear me when others attack me for my identity. This is why I unequivocally apologize.’

Omar, however, stuck to her guns in blasting the problems of lobbyists and their financial influence in politics.
‘At the same time, I reaffirm the problematic role lobbyists in our politics, whether it be AIPAC, the NRA or the fossil fuel industry. It’s gone on too long and we must be willing to address it,’ Omar said. She tweeted out her statement with the words: ‘Listening and learning, but standing strong.’
The freshman Democrat caused outrage with a tweet Sunday night linking support for Israel to financial contributions with her words: ‘It’s all about the Benjamins.’
 Pelosi and her entire leadership team issued a blistering statement after Omar, in her first months in office, penned successive tweets on matter.
‘Anti-Semitism must be called out, confronted and condemned whenever it is encountered, without exception,’ Pelosi and her team wrote.
‘We are and will always be strong supporters of Israel in Congress because we understand that our support is based on shared values and strategic interests. Legitimate criticism of Israel’s policies is protected by the values of free speech and democratic debate that the United States and Israel share. But Congresswoman Omar’s use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel’s supporters is deeply offensive. We condemn these remarks and we call upon Congresswoman Omar to immediately apologize for these hurtful comments.’
