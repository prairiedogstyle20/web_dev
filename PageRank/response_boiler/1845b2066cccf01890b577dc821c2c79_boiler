Pope Sings Lullabies, President Trump Confronts Abortion Advocates
Missing from the group shot, but there in spirit among the white-garbed pro-abortion Democrats who turned out for the State of the Union address last night, the Bishop of Rome.
Like all loudly caterwauling hypocritical progressive-lefties, Pope Francis is big on women, but never there for babies.
On the day of SOTU, the most lukewarm Catholic pontiff of recent times purportedly fessed up to the gobsmacking scandal that nuns have been—and may still be—sexually assaulted by bishops and priests—all the way up to their being kept in ongoing sex slavery.
.
“Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Francis noted that Pope Benedict XVI had taken action against a France-based order after some of its religious sisters had been reduced to “sexual slavery” at the hands of the priest who founded the order and other priests.” ()
This was a stunning confession made on the aircraft taking him back to Rome after his historic visit to the United Arab Emirates, including the first-ever papal Mass in the birthplace of Islam.
According to the current Marxist-leaning pontiff, Pope Benedict XVI shut down the sex slave order in 2005.
It is now 2019.  Why are we just hearing abut this now?
“Before he became pope, Benedict was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the head of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican department that investigates sexual abuse. The pope at the time was John Paul. ( Mirror , Feb. 5, 2019)
“Then-cardinal Ratzinger wanted to investigate the religious order where women were being abused but he was blocked, Pope Francis said, without saying who prevented the probe.
“After he became Pope, Ratzinger reopened the investigation and dissolved the order, Francis said.”
It took 14 long years before Benedict’s courageous efforts would ever see sunlight again.
Most politically Pope Francis also noted that the mistreatment of women is a problem in society at large, where women are still considered “second-class citizens.”
“It’s a cultural problem. I dare say that humanity hasn’t matured,” he said, adding that in some parts of the world the mistreatment gets to the point of feminicide.” ( CBC , Feb. 6, 2019)
Doesn’t anyone find the timing of this confession noteworthy?
Where are you Catholic journos?
“It’s not that everyone does this, but there have been priests and bishops who have,” Francis added. “And I think that it’s continuing because it’s not like once you realize it that it stops. It continues. And for some time we’ve been working on it.” (CBC)
Surely someone should be asking him to show us the proof of his having been working on it for “some time”.
“The issue has come to the fore amid the Catholic Church’s overall reckoning with the sexual abuse of minors and the #MeToo-inspired acknowledgement that adults can be victims of abuse whenever there is an imbalance of power in a relationship. In the past year, The Associated Press and other media have reported on cases of abused nuns in India, Africa, Europe and South America — evidence that the problem is by no means limited to a certain geographic area.” (CBC)
 
“Francis credited Benedict, pope from 2005-2013, with having had the courage to tackle the problem, saying the popular impression that he was somehow weak was completely wrong.
“He said Benedict took action against the French congregation “because a certain slavery of women had crept in, slavery to the point of sexual slavery on the part of clergy or the founder,” he said.
“Sometimes the founder takes away, or empties the freedom of the sisters. It can come to this,” Francis said.
“Asked if any universal norms might be in the works to tackle the problem — as has been done to handle cases of clergy sexual abuse of minors — Francis implied that the priestly abuse of nuns was still being dealt with on a case-by-case basis.
When is disgraced Cardinal Theodore McCarrick going to be dealt with on a “case-by-case” basis?
Interesting to note that throughout all the Bishop of Rome has been singularly silent on partial and post-birth abortions being legislated by the governors of New York, Virginia, Rhode Island and others.
Pope Francis’s new pastoral strategy for confronting abortion is singing lullabies.  ( Tablet , Jan. 28, 2019)
On his flight back from 2019 World Youth Day in Panama, he told journalists on Jan. 27:  “I tell them their child is in heaven, talk to him, I tell them to sing them a lullaby, the lullaby that they had never been able to sing.”
 
It was President Donald Trump who made it clear in his SOTU address last night that late-term abortion will no longer be tolerated:
“There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.
“To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb.
“Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children—born and unborn—are made in the holy image of God.”
In other words, last night the President of the United States was doing what should be Pope Francis’s job for him.
Thank You, Holy Spirit for sending in a pinch hitter in defense of babies being torn from their mothers’ wombs in the indefensible scourge called Abortion.
