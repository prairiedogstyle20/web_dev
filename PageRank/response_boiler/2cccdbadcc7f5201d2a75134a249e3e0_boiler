The Democrat — who has said he will announce a decision by the end of the month on whether he will run for the White House in 2020 — had previously warned in a Medium post the president would be coming to the state to “repeat his lies about the dangers that immigrants pose”.
“The President, using the same racist, inflammatory rhetoric of years past, seeks to build a wall, to take kids from their parents, to deploy the United States Army on American soil, to continue mass deportations and to end the protection for Dreamers. In other words, he seeks in one administration to repeat all the mistakes of the last half-century,” Mr O’Rourke wrote in the post. “And with past as prologue, we know exactly how that will end.”
Donald Trump boasts he'll 'build the wall anyway'
Mr O’Rourke went on to assert a border wall “will lead to greater suffering and death for immigrants who are pushed to more dangerous points of crossing” and “will not do a single thing to reduce the number of undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers coming to this country.”
Mr O’Rourke wasn’t the only Texan to call out Mr Trump on his misleading statements.

“I believe [Mr Trump] was given some misinformation,” Dee Margo, the Republican mayor of El Paso, Texas, told CNN , adding the president’s border wall claims in the region were “not factually correct”. 
The city’s sheriff Richard Wiles also rebuked Mr Trump’s comments, saying , “The facts are clear. While it is true that El Paso is one of the safest cities in the nation, it has never been '...considered one of our Nation’s most dangerous cities.”
On Monday night, Mr O’Rourke, who was met with chants to run in 2020, laid out a different approach to immigration reform than the president, one led by “compassion” rather than increased deportations and a sprawling border wall. 
“With the eyes of the country upon us, all of us together are going to make our stand here in one of the safest cities in America,” he said. “Safe not because of walls but in spite of walls.”
