Are there crimes committed in the USA by illegal immigrants? Yes. Would there be fewer illegal immigrants in the future if we enhance border and immigration security and build a barrier than there would be if we did not? Of course.
The degree is an unknown and depends on factors that include how bad things get in Central and South America, let alone Mexico. However, some degree of crime prevention would happen if we build a wall is a common sense, not a medieval fantasy.

Moreover, the worse things get to the south, the more illegal crossings will be attempted. So building a barrier and enhancing border and immigration security is a sound investment as insurance. We are wealthy enough to build a wall, walls are effective, and the pretense that this is fantasy does not impress from those wanting to redo our entire economy in 10 years based on a dubious theory of pseudoscience.
I thought I heard somewhere that we have a backlog of 900,000 immigration cases, that alone is a reason for an effective wall. We shouldn’t allow ANY illegal aliens to set foot into the United States. That should be the enforced policy.
