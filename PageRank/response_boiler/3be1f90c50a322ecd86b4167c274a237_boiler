Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., lost his mind this week and accused President Donald Trump of “criminalizing” illegal alien drunk drivers.
During an interview Monday on CNN with host Wolf Blitzer, Menendez attacked Trump for apparently being too harsh on illegal aliens that drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

The segment began with Blitzer asking Menendez about a section in the border wall deal from Republicans and Democratic lawmakers.
Democratic lawmakers want to limit the number of illegal aliens that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement can detain at one time.
Democrats want fewer beds to house illegal aliens, meaning they would be let go and some would be able to walk freely in the U.S.
Republicans argue this would allow more violent and criminal illegal aliens to evade detection and remain in the U.S.
Menendez didn’t see it that way and blamed ICE’s enforcement policies for detaining more illegal aliens than Congress allocated funding for.
“The reason that [ICE is] already 8,000 [beds] over their budgeted amount – so they’re violating the budget – is because of the president’s zero-tolerance policy that has turned everyone, regardless of their record, into a criminal,” Menendez said.
“If you cross the border undocumented, [Trump] has now made you a criminal,” Menendez said. “If a person has a driving while under the influence (DUI) violation, he is now making that, saying that’s criminal.”
Growing more visibly frustrated, Menendez then attacked Trump.
“Because he tears children away from their mothers and puts them all in detention facilities, he has an over-demand as a result of his policy, so it’s his policy that’s driving this,” Menendez continued.

When Blitzer noted that former President Barack Obama also criminalized illegal immigration and separated families at the U.S.-Mexico border, Menendez was not having it.
The New Jersey Democrat was only interested in blaming Trump and ICE for wanting to keep illegal criminals detained.

“That’s different than what we’re talking about and what’s driving this demand for beds. It’s his demand to take everybody — look, I had a grandfather from New Jersey who’s been here over 20 years. Works hard. Never had a criminal record,” Menendez said.
“They wanted to deport him. They wanted to detain him. That’s not the essence of brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, who otherwise have been law-abiding in every other respect. He wants to incarcerate them as well as he seeks to deport them. Far different from criminal aliens,” he added.
Democrats argue that a bed cap would force ICE to prioritize detainment of dangerous criminals.
ICE officials say the Democrat proposal would result in violent illegal aliens escaping into the U.S., which would allow some to evade immigration officials.
This could be very dangerous for innocent Americans if criminal illegals are allowed to walk scotch free, which is what Democrats are pushing for.
