Among the many things President Trump attacked during his first campaign rally of the 2020 election season was Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez‘s Green New Deal, saying it sounds like a “high school term paper that got a low mark.” And while Trump can dish out the colorful insults, AOC can dish it right back, and that’s exactly what she did in a Twitter post this Monday night.
White House Correspondent for Breitbart News Charlie Spiering tweeted out the Trump quote, and it caught’s AOC’s eye soon after, prompting her to retweet the quote with the following observation:
“Ah yes, a man who can’t even read briefings written in full sentences is providing literary criticism of a House Resolution.”
She then followed up by citing the Washington Post, writing the line, “Reading the intelligence book is not Trump’s preferred ‘style of learning,’ according to a person with knowledge of the situation.”
Ah yes, a man who can’t even read briefings written in full sentences is providing literary criticism of a House Resolution.
(“Reading the intelligence book is not Trump’s preferred ‘style of learning,’ according to a person with knowledge of the situation.”

AOC was referring to a Washington Post report from Saturday that said Trump “rarely if ever” reads the Presidential daily briefings, which lay out “the most pressing information collected by U.S. intelligence agencies from hot spots around the world.”
“Trump has opted to rely on an oral briefing of select intelligence issues in the Oval Office rather than getting the full written document delivered to review separately each day, according to three people familiar with his briefings,” Wapo reported.
The Green New Deal resolution , which had a rocky rollout  by AOC last week, aims to “achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions” within 10 years, among other things which include “a job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security to all people of the United States.”
While it has broad support from progressives, the resolution has come under intense criticism from both liberals and conservatives.
Trump attacked the resolution from Twitter as well, taunting Democrats to “press forward with their Green New Deal.”
“It would be great for the so-called “Carbon Footprint” to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military – even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant!” Trump tweeted on Saturday .
Whether one likes AOC policies or not, it’s hard to deny that her Twitter game is miles above most people in D.C., including Trump.
