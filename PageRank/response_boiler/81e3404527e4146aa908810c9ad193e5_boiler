Introductory pack of 6 beginners eyeshades.
These are an entry level eyeshade which clubs and schools can purchase in order to introduce players to blind sports without the expense of having to buy the more sophisticated eyeshades that we offer.
They are aimed at helping clubs and schools increase participation at an affordable price and are better quality than fabric eyeshades. The introductory eyeshades are not suitable for tournament or international level events but are an excellent affordable beginners eyeshade. They enable the wearer to discover whether they enjoy the sports first and foremost before hopefully participating on a more regular basis when they can graduate to the Mk1 or Eclipse models.
