President Donald Trump has called on freshman Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar to resign over her controversial Israel comments.
“Anti-Semitism has no place in the United States Congress,” Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting.
“I think she should either resign from Congress or she should certainly resign from the foreign affairs committee.”
The call for Omar’s resignation came after Trump said Monday the Minnesota Democrat “ should be ashamed of herself ”.

Omar apologized Monday for comments in which she implied that a prominent pro-Israel lobby compensated lawmakers for their support of the Jewish state, but insisted on what she called "the problematic role of lobbyists in our politics."
She drew condemnation from members of both parties after she tweeted Sunday evening that AIPAC has been paying members of Congress to support Israel. On Monday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called on Omar to apologize, saying that "her use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel's supporters is deeply offensive."
REPUBLICAN REP. LEE ZELDIN DISMISSES ILHAN OMAR'S 'SORRY NOT SORRY' APOLOGY, BLASTS 'ANTI-ISRAEL' HATE
Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said it was "shocking to hear a Member of Congress invoke the anti-Semitic trope of 'Jewish money.'" Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., called the comments "deeply disappointing and disturbing."
However, the apology is not enough for some lawmakers, with Lee Zeldin, a Jewish Republican from New York, describing it as a ‘sorry not sorry’ apology.
