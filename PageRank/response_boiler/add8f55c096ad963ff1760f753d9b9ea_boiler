BOILING SPRINGS - Former Burns High standout Josh Ramseur will get another year at Gardner-Webb.
Ramseur, a 2014 Burns High graduate, was granted a sixth season of eligibility by the NCAA and will play the 2019 season as a graduate student.
A former All-Big South Conference defensive lineman, Ramseur had been a preseason 2018 all-league selection before an injury knocked out for the season.
"We really missed Josh’s leadership and ability last season in the middle,” G-W head coach Carroll McCray said of the 5-foot-11, 290-pounder in a G-W news release. "His return will shore up our defensive front, with several returning players who gained valuable experience in his absence. We are very excited with the news that Josh will have a sixth year to finish his career here. He’s an All-Conference caliber young man."
Gardner-Webb finished 3-8 overall and 2-3 in the Big South last season without Ramseur as many underclassmen filled in on the Bulldogs' defensive front.
He will rejoin a defensive line that welcomes back six of its top seven men from the 2018 season, including 2017 Forestview High graduate Tremayne Booker in addition to adding two other interior linemen who were injured last season, among them 2017 Lincolnton High graduate Donnie Thompson.
In three seasons at G-W, Ramseur has 95 tackles (6 1-2 for losses) and one blocked kick in 27 games. He had 50 tackles (2 for losses) in his all-conference 2017 season.
The extra year will allow for a Ramseur against Ramseur family battle early next season as younger brother Aaron Ramseur, a 2016 Crest High graduate, plays for East Carolina; The Bulldogs face ECU for the first time on Sept. 7.
Older brothers Kenneth Ramseur (Gardner-Webb), Tim Ramseur (N.C. State and Appalachian State) and Tank Ramseur (Tuskegee) also played college football.
