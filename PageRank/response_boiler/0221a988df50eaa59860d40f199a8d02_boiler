COLCHESTER is set to get its seventh Subway fast food restaurant as part of the redevelopment of a former sports shop at a retail park.
PureGym has submitted plans to convert the old DW Sports unit at Colchester Retail Park, in Sheepen Road, into one of its gyms, as well as adding a takeaway restaurant.
The gym would be open 24 hours, seven days a week, creating approximately 14 new part-time and full-time job opportunities.
A planning statement reads: "The proposed gym at Colchester Retail Park will comprise a main gym area, studio, free weights area, spin area and functional zone.
"In addition, changing facilities and showers will be provided, as well as a small seating area for the use of members, and staff facilities.
"In total, with the addition of the mezzanine floor, the gym will provide 1,395 sq. m of floorspace."
A new entrance be created at the front of the premises for Subway, which already has town centre stores in High Street, Head Street and St Botolph’s Street as well as three more chains further afield at Turner Rise Retail Park, Lightship Way and Stanway Retail Park.
Subway will occupy the smaller unit once the premises are redivided and would have independent access via the rear of the property.
The statement adds: "The application scheme will deliver sustainable economic growth, provide new employment opportunities and create real social benefits in terms of providing affordable and accessible fitness facilities that will promote the health of local communities and serve to reduce health inequalities within Colchester and the surrounding area."
"The location of the proposed gym is accessible, served by adequate car parking.
"The 24-hour operation of the site will not give rise to any unacceptable impacts on neighbouring properties and PureGym adopts extensive measures to ensure a safe and secure environment for its members.
"We therefore consider that this proposal meets all relevant requirements of local and national planning policy, and we commend this planning application to the Borough Council."
