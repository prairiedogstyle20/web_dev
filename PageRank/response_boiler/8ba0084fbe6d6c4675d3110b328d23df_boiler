President Trump called on beleaguered Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar to resign Tuesday amid widespread backlash over her alleging secret Jewish money is controlling U.S. foreign policy on Israel — claims she has since apologized for.
“Omar is terrible,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House. “I think she should either resign from Congress or she should certainly resign from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.”

Trump also took aim at the North Star State Democrat’s mea culpa, which she issued amid pressure from Democratic Party brass.
“What she said is so deep-seated in her heart that her lame apology, and that's what it was; it was lame, and she didn’t mean a word of it,” the President said. “I think she should resign from Congress, frankly.”
Omar, who’s Muslim and the first member of Congress to ever wear a hijab in the House chamber, stoked outrage over the weekend when she issued a pair of tweets that critics said had deeply anti-Semitic undertones.
“It’s all about the Benjamins baby,” Omar first posted in response to a news article reporting that Republicans were threatening repercussions for her support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which seeks to put economic pressure on Israel over its occupation of Palestinian territories.
Asked by a Twitter user who she exactly thought was paying politicians to be pro-Israel, Omar responded, “AIPAC!”
The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, also known as AIPAC, is a powerful lobbying group that spends millions of dollars each year on pro-Israel lobbying efforts in Congress.
High-profile Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said Omar’s tweets perpetuated a long-held anti-Semitic trope that Jews are infiltrating politics through wealth. Critics also contended Omar’s usage of the word “Benjamins” in reference to money took on problematic semantics.
Omar, 37, agreed and issued a statement “unequivocally” apologizing for her comments. However, she also said she believes lobbyists — regardless of ethnicity or beliefs — play a “problematic” role in U.S. politics and said “we must be willing to address it.”
Some of Omar’s allies came to her defense after Trump’s pushback.
“Unlike this President, Rep. Omar demonstrated a capacity to acknowledge pain and apologize, use the opportunity to learn about history of antisemitism, +grow from it while clarifying her stance,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) tweeted.
Trump, meanwhile, has faced his own share of accusations of anti-Semitism and racism.
In the wake of the deadly far-right rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017, Trump refused to unambiguously condemn white supremacy, blaming “both sides” for the violence that erupted and even saying there were “fine people” among the throngs of neo-Nazis attending the event.
Anti-fascist activist Heather Heyer was killed during the Charlottesville protests after Adolf Hitler fanatic James Fields plowed his sports car into a crowd. She was 32-years-old and the only person who died in the chaos.
