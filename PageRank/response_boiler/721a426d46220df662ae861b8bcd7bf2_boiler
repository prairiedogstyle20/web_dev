Frequently asked questions
Gift wrapping and packaging
Most of our jewelry items already come in pretty jewelry bags or boxes.  We have been asked to gift wrap a time or two....just let us know what you need and we will see if we can help you with your request.  We always strive to make our customers happy.
Shipping to CANADA
We are more than happy to negotiate a price if you live in Canada and wish to purchase an item.  We typically will just have a shipping price for USA and International.  We understand that we can ship Postal to Canada cheaper...so let us know if you are interested and we will work on making it happen so we all are happy!
Why The Increase In Shipping & Handling?
Unfortunately, the USPS is currently increasing their rates, which is affecting a lot of Etsy stores.  I am still trying to keep my rates down as much as possible whenever I am able.  Please also remember, that we have to cover costs in our supplies as well to safely pack and ship your items.  We use shipping paper, bubble wrap, tissue, etc. to safely wrap your items...and use nice shipping boxes so that we don't have to utilize pre-used boxes very often as they sometimes collapse during shipping due to overuse.  If you have any specific questions, please always feel free to reach out to me and I will be happy to discuss the price with you.  Thank you for your understanding.
What Is Your Clearance Section?
The items in our Clearance section are items that we are only going to have left in our store for 3-4 more months before they are removed completely to make room for NEW INVENTORY!  All of the prices that you will see have been reduced by 20-50% from their original listing price.
Just because they are on Clearance does not mean that there is anything wrong with the items!  We do not list items that are damaged, broke, or inferior in any way (unless they are vintage and otherwise noted).
We will be continually adding items to this section!
If you have any questions, please let us know.  Thank you so much!
Why Do You Say "Comes From A Smoke Free And Pet Free Home" - Do you Discriminate Against Smokers and Pet Owners?
I actually was asked this question a couple of times now.  For the record...we do not discriminate against ANYONE!  We love ALL of our customers!  The reason we note this on our listings is to let people know that the items you receive will be clean, not be covered in pet hair and not have a musty or smoky smell to them.  It is just a courtesy that we provide to make sure you receive the best product that we can deliver to you!
