President Donald Trump talks to reporters during a meeting of his cabinet at the White House on Tuesday.
President Donald Trump on Tuesday called on Rep. Ilhan Omar to quit Congress over remarks that were criticized as anti-Semitic, as he said he wasn’t happy with a border-security agreement but didn’t indicate he’d reject it.
NOT ‘THRILLED’ WITH BORDER DEAL
Speaking at a cabinet meeting, Trump said “I can’t say I’m happy” about the deal, which includes $1.38 billion to build 55 miles of new barriers along the border with Mexico. That’s far below the $5.7 billion Trump demanded to build more than 200 miles of wall. “I can’t say I’m thrilled,” he said.
But the president said “I don’t think you’re going to see a shutdown,” and said there would be a meeting later. Without congressional action by 12:01 a.m. Saturday, the government would again partially shut down.
Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who was one of the negotiators, told MSNBC lawmakers weren’t trying to pass something that would “thrill” the president.

OMAR’S APOLOGY ‘LAME’
A day after Omar apologized for comments she made, Trump said he thought the Minnesota Democrat should either leave Congress or step down from a panel she serves on.
“It’s terrible what she said and I think she should either resign from Congress or she should certainly resign from the House Foreign Affairs Committee,” Trump said.
He called the freshman lawmaker’s apology “lame.” After suggesting support for Israel on Capitol Hill is driven by money, Omar said she was grateful for Jewish “allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes.” She added that “At the same time, I reaffirm the problematic role of lobbyists in our politics, whether it be [the American Israel Public Affairs Committee], the NRA or the fossil fuel industry,” Omar added.

Also at the cabinet meeting, Trump said he is thinking of putting on a Fourth of July parade or “gathering,” perhaps at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington. “We’re thinking about doing something which would become perhaps become a tradition, Salute to America,” Trump said. The president has previously expressed a desire for a military parade, but canceled plans for one.
XI MEETING
Trump was noncommittal on the timing of a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying only he intended to see Xi sometime in the future. He spoke as U.S. and Chinese officials are meeting in Beijing and focusing on producing a broad outline of a trade deal for their presidents to clinch at a possible summit.
He said the Chinese “very much want to make a deal.”
