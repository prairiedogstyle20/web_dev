A majority of the Americans polled in a new survey supports congressional investigations into the Trump administration.
Sixty percent of respondents said they support “Democrats in Congress conducting investigations into senior officials in the Trump administration,”  according to the poll , which was given exclusively to The Hill by Restore Public Trust, a Democrat-linked interest group. More than one-third — 39 percent — said they “strongly support” such inquiries.
Forty percent said they disapprove of the probes.

Support for the Democratic investigations held steady at 60 percent after respondents read language claiming the investigations would be a “politically-motivated witch hunt.”
Additionally, 84 percent of respondents said they agree with the statement, “No one is above the law. Congress has investigated past presidential administrations. The Trump administration shouldn’t get a special pass.”
The poll comes as House Democrats flex their investigative muscles as the new majority in the lower chamber, with several committees opening probes into the White House.
Donald John Trump House committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE , is reopening that committee's investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow in 2016 and any ties between Trump’s personal businesses and foreign powers.
The House Oversight and Reform Committee has also launched a probe into the White House security clearance process, and the House Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee held a hearing last week discussing a tax law concerning presidential tax returns. 
Trump excoriated Democrats during his State of the Union address last week, suggesting that “ridiculous partisan investigations” would impede legislation working through Capitol Hill as well as national economic progress.
Global Strategy Group and GBA Strategies, which conducted the poll on Restore Public Trust’s behalf, surveyed 1,012 registered voters nationwide and 400 registered voters in battleground congressional districts from Jan. 8-15. Their results have a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
