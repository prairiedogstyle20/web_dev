A Florida woman is facing multiple charges after she allegedly racially abused a black police officer and made threatening remarks referencing the Ku Klux Klan (KKK.)
The incident occurred on February 7 as Volusia County Sheriff's Office deputy Brandon King was called to a “disturbance” at a home in DeLand, Florida, the Miami Herald reported.
When King arrived at the scene, he found 53-year-old Julie Edwards trying to leave in her car, but he managed to stop her. After approaching the vehicle, he noticed a strong smell of alcohol on her breath and that she was slurring her words. He asked Edwards if she would take a breathalyzer test and perform field sobriety exercises. She declined.
At this point King decided to take Edwards into custody, but she attempted to walk away and resisted when the deputy tried to put her in his vehicle, according to the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office.
Once she was in the vehicle, Edwards began her tirade against King, much of which was captured by the deputy's bodycam as they drove back to the police station. The video was posted by the Sheriff’s Office on its official twitter account.
“Watch this if you need any more proof there's no expiration date on ignorance,” the post read. “You may have heard someone made racist threats against one of our deputies. Before you go on a racist rant, just remember we have body cams.”
In the video, Edwards told King that the KKK would find him and that there wasn’t anything wrong “with a burning cross” in his yard.
“KKK’s got your ass boy,” she can be heard saying in the video, in which she refers to King by the n-word. "They’ll send all you f****** back… burn the rest of you. My KKK friends will burn your family, you should never be here in the first place. You ever been whipped on a whipping post?"
King kept his composure throughout. "Kudos to Deputy King for his calm response to all the racist garbage this KKK Enthusiast could throw at him," Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood wrote on Twitter in response to the video. "Great job Deputy & thank you to everyone condemning the hate in this video!"
Police have now charged Edwards with driving under the influence of alcohol, making a threat against a law enforcement officer, refusing to submit for testing and resisting an officer without violence, according to Volusia County Jail Corrections records.
