Donald John Trump House committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE recently had a new "golf simulator" installed in his personal quarters at the White House, according to The Washington Post. 
The newspaper, citing multiple people informed about the system, reported on Tuesday that the simulator cost about $50,000 and allows Trump to play rounds of golf at courses around the globe by hitting a ball into a large video screen. 
The system replaced an older version that former President Obama had installed in the White House, two people told the Post. 
A White House official told the newspaper that Trump personally paid for the game and its installation. The official added that Trump has not used the system during "Executive Time" since it was installed. 
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Hill. 
Axios reported earlier this month that Trump had spent about 60 percent of his time in "Executive Time" over the last three months. He is considered to be watching television, reading newspapers and making phone calls to aides, lawmakers, friends, advisers and administration officials during those allotted hours. 
Trump has contended that he is generally working during those hours, tweeting on Sunday that he probably works "more hours than almost any past president." 
Trump has frequently taken to the links during his two years in the White House. According to a Washington Post analysis, he has golfed approximately 139 times as president. 
He golfed with Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus at his course in Jupiter, Fla., on Feb. 2, representing the first time he golfed in 69 days. It marked the longest time he spent away from a golf course as president. 
The White House has a decorated history of president's making changes to serve their desires. For example, Obama turned a tennis court into a full basketball court and added his own golf simulator, according to the Post.
