Rush Limbaugh emerged as one of the largest voices in conservative politics for a reason.
He has the ability to point out the left’s own plans before the Democrats themselves do.
And this time, he just exposed the biggest threat to Trump that no one is talking about.
Rush Limbaugh has long been able to call out the left’s political tactics before the rest of the country catches on.
And with the 2020 election cycle already underway, all eyes are on the wave of Democratic candidates eager to run for President.
But there’s just one problem.
The biggest threat to Trump isn’t Elizabeth Warren, Corey Booker, or Kamala Harris.
It’s the ideology each is pushing.
Limbaugh explained over the weekend how the concept of “Democratic Socialism,” which is the left’s new re-packaging of the same set of ideas they’ve pushed for decades, is the real culprit.
“I want to transition to the Green New Deal, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of her merry band that proposed this thing yesterday,” Limbaugh said.
“And I have to tell you that I think — and I hope I’m wrong about this — but it appears to me that we still have a whole lot of people who do not understand what we are up against.”
Limbaugh went on to explain how the “ Green New Deal ” is more or less the same impractical set of policies Democrats have pushed since the 1980s.
“I’ve had my fun with this for 30 years, and I’m telling you: That hasn’t worked. Not when the Democrat Party is being open and up front about what they want to do to this country. It used to be fringe. It used to be extreme. It used to be wacko. It used to be blatantly insane nuts,” said Limbaugh.
But it’s no longer fringe or extreme. The policies Ocasio-Cortez and others are proposing have become mainstream.
They’ve moved to what is called the “Overton Window” – what is considered acceptable by the American public.
Limbaugh then detailed exactly what the dangers with that are, and he used Ocasio-Cortez’s own internet celebrity status as an example.
“Her [Ocasio-Cortez] Twitter followers eagerly defend her from every stupid utterance that she makes. She is shielded and protected from this stupidity and naivete. They prop her up at every opportunity.”
“Whereas she might learn from failure and might learn from some of these mistakes, she’s not given the chance. They prop her up. They continue to fill her with this head-expanding, head-swilling idolatry to the point that she is approaching (in her own mind) goddess-like status.”
Conservatives mock Ocasio-Cortez and others who have jumped on her bandwagon.
But Limbaugh warns that this should not be taken lightly.
“They believe it all, and it is a mistake — it is a mistake —  to assume that the vast majority of the American people are gonna see the folly of this.  It is a big mistake to think that.”
It’s clear that the ideas espoused in the Green New Deal are picking up steam.
Kamala Harris just endorsed “eliminating” private health insurance across the country.
Almost every Democrat candidate for President is running on a complete government takeover of the healthcare industry.
And several Democrats were elected to Congress in 2018 on this platform.
Mocking the left’s embrace of socialism hasn’t stemmed its tide over the past 30 years.
And Limbaugh is now sounding the alarm that the only way to stop it is to confront it head on.
Do you agree with Limbaugh?
