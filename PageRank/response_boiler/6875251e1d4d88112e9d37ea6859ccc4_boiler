President Trump signaled Tuesday he’s prepared to give up his $5.7 billion border-wall funding demand and sign a new bipartisan budget proposal that would avert an imminent government shutdown — but he said he won’t completely give up on his wall.
Speaking during a Cabinet meeting at the White House, Trump said he’s “not thrilled” about the new spending agreement — which has no wall funding — but affirmed he “certainly” doesn’t want to bring the government to another standstill over the legislation.

“I’m not happy about it. It's not doing the trick,” Trump said, as the Friday shutdown deadline drew nearer. “But I’m adding things to it. And when you add whatever I have to add, it’s all going to happen where we’re going to build a beautiful, big, strong wall.”
It was not clear what the President was talking about.
He doesn’t have the authority to add funds to a federal budget and neither can he take funds appropriated for specific purposes and use them for other initiatives.
However, Trump has long hinted he’s willing to declare a national emergency, which would, in theory, allow him to appropriate money from the Pentagon budget and use it towards building a wall.
But Democrats and legal experts say such a declaration would invariably be rejected in the courts, especially since Trump has undermined his own sense of emergency by dragging the issue on for weeks.
Trump shrugged off such legal concerns Tuesday.
“We can declare if we want to do it,” he said of the emergency.
The final text for the spending agreement reached Monday night by a bipartisan conference committee has not yet been released, but congressional aides familiar with the matter said it includes $1.375 billion for the construction of 55 miles of border barriers — $4.3 billion shy of Trump’s demand and $300 million less than an agreement the President rejected last year.
Moreover, the legislation contains language specifying the barriers can only be modeled after “currently deployed designs,” one aide told the Daily News.
Approved designs include so-called bollard fences — or “steel slats,” as Trump calls them. Bollards have been built before, the source added, “ruling out the President’s border wall.”
Additionally, the source said the proposed budget provides a path to reduce the number of detention beds that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has at its disposal from 49,057 to 40,520, a 17% drop.
Democrats had initially requested an ever steeper decrease in beds, but backed off in response to firm Republican opposition.
The Dems say the bed reduction will force ICE to focus on deporting and detaining criminals instead of undocumented immigrants who have committed no crimes but being in the country illegally.
Republicans viewed the budget plan with rose-colored glasses, claiming victory even though the measure poses a major concession for the President, who used to repeatedly promise that Mexico would pay for a concrete wall spanning the entire southern border.

“I think he’s got a pretty good deal here,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters, adding he had personally urged Trump to sign the bill. “I think he’s done just fine and I hope he’ll conclude that because he has to sign the bill.”
Both chambers are set to quickly take up the measure and send it to Trump’s desk well ahead of the Friday midnight shutdown deadline.
At that point, Trump can either sign the legislation and spare hundreds of thousands of workers from being furloughed again or veto it and cause the second government shutdown in as many months.
Republicans and the White House are intent on avoiding another shutdown, following the 35-day funding impasse that ensued after Trump refused bipartisan legislation in December that would have put up more border barrier cash than the bill he’s now suggesting he’s ready to sign.
The shutdown, which was the longest in American history, left 800,000 government workers without paychecks and stalled everything from FBI counterintelligence operations to national park services.
Democrats urged Trump to not put the country through another shutdown.
"We now have a bipartisan proposal to accomplish our goals, better secure the border, and avoid another senseless government shutdown," Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said from the Senate floor.
"We must not have a rerun of what happened a few months back where legislators, Democrat and Republican, House and Senate, agreed, and President Trump pulled the rug out from under the agreement and caused the shutdown.”
