I suppose there’s not much else you can do when you’ve been caught dead-to-rights as an anti-Semite:
Point the finger at someone the media desperately wants to attack instead of you:
Hi @realDonaldTrump –
You have trafficked in hate your whole life—against Jews, Muslims, Indigenous, immigrants, black people and more. I learned from people impacted by my words. When will you? https://t.co/EqqTyjkiNE

For the record, I have yet to see a single convincing example of Trump hating any of those mentioned above. He often speaks in a non-PC manner, and he pursues policies that don’t conform to what social justice warriors demand as proof of your wokeness.

But what is the actual evidence of Trump hating any of these groups, apart from the left and the media (but I repeat myself) claiming he does?
He certainly hasn’t taken to Twitter and accused anyone of supporting the above groups in exchange for money.

He thrilled Israel by moving our embassy there to Jerusalem after all other recent presidents broke their promises to do so.
He pursued an immigration policy that restricted travel from terror-heavy countries, but not because of anyone’s religion.
Should Democrats punish Ilhan Omar for her hatred of Jews?

He condemned white supremacists and Antifa equally, which was appropriate, as they both suck and Trump was right to say so.
You can ask his black supporters – starting with our boss, Kanye West and Ben Carson – what happens to them as a result of their support for Trump. They get attacked plenty for it, but not by Trump. They get attacked by the left.
I realize there are many things Trump has said and done that the left insist are “racist dog whistles” or whatever, but show me a statement he’s made, or an action he’s taken, that represents evidence of actual hate toward anyone.

I don’t think you can. Yet we know Ilhan Omar hates Jews, and she’s learning nothing except how not to embarrass her Democrat colleagues by being so obvious about it.
Nice try taking the focus off of you, but we’re going to make sure it gets put right back on you, Congresswoman. You are a disgrace. You’re worse than Steve King, and the Republicans stripped him of all his committee assignments.
I await Nancy Pelosi’s decision to do the same to Omar, and I’d like to know why it hasn’t already happened.
