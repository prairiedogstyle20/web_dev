Mueller’s still not done, but the Senate Intelligence Committee is preparing to wrap up its investigation.
Surprise! It hasn’t uncovered any evidence of “collusion.” NONE. ZERO. NADA. Keep in mind that this is coming from both Republicans and Democrats on the committee. It’s totally bipartisan.
WASHINGTON — After two years and 200 interviews, the Senate Intelligence Committee is approaching the end of  its investigation into the 2016 election, having uncovered no direct evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, according to  both Democrats and Republicans  on the committee.
Don’t forget what Sen. Richard Burr said last week: “If we write a report based upon the facts that we have, then we don’t have anything that would suggest there was collusion by the Trump campaign and Russia.”
“We know we’re getting to the bottom of the barrel because there’re not new questions that we’re searching for answers to,” Burr said.
Democratic Senate investigators who spoke to NBC News on condition of anonymity did not dispute Burr’s characterizations, but said they lacked context.
“We were never going find a contract signed in blood saying, ‘Hey Vlad, we’re going to collude,'” one Democratic aide said.
No blood contracts that we’re aware of. Sorry Dems.
