US President Donald Trump on Tuesday called on Democratic Congresswoman Ilan Omar to step down following a series of tweets she posted that were widely condemned as antisemitic .
The president’s statement came a day after the freshman legislator from Minnesota issued an apology in which she claimed she had never meant to “offend my constituents or Jewish Americans as a whole.”
At a cabinet meeting at the White House on Tuesday, Trump said, “Antisemitism has no place in the United States Congress. And Congressman Omar is terrible, what she said. And I think she should either resign from Congress or she should certainly resign from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.”
“What she said is so deep-seated in her heart that her lame apology — and that’s what it was; it was lame, and she didn’t mean a word of it — was just not appropriate,” he added. “I think she should resign from Congress, frankly. But at a minimum, she shouldn’t be on committees, and certainly that committee.”
In the tweets in question, which were published on Sunday, the 37-year-old Omar suggested that AIPAC bought political support for Israel with donations to lawmakers.
