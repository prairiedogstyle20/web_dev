President Donald Trump weighed in again Tuesday on the controversy surrounding antisemitic remarks by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who apologized Monday at the behest of Democratic leaders but kept her committee posts.
Trump told a Cabinet meeting open to reporters: “I think [Omar] should either resign from Congress or she should certainly resign from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.” He also cast doubt on the sincerity of her apology .
His full remarks, via pool report, were as follows:
Anti-Semitism has no place in the United States Congress. And Congressman Omar, it’s terrible what she said and I think she should either resign from Congress or she should certainly resign from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
What she said is so deep-seeded in her heart that her lame apology, that’s what it was, it was lame and she didn’t mean a word of it, was just not appropriate.
I think she should resign from Congress frankly, but at a minimum she shouldn’t be on committees, certainly that committee.
Omar apologized but vowed to continue criticizing the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the pro-Israel lobbying organization that she falsely accused of paying members of Congress to support Israel.
Omar’s offending tweets — from this and another occasion — remain live.
