The former top attorney for President Trump said that he does not believe Special Counsel Robert Mueller will release a final report, and called the investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia a “terrible waste of time.”
Speaking to an ABC News podcast, John Dowd, who left the Trump legal team in March 2018 said, “I don’t think there’ll be a report. I will be shocked if anything regarding the president is made public, other than ‘We’re done.’”
“I ran big corruption cases,” he said. “I didn’t go around, picking scabs and just making any case I could make. If there was a petty case, I shifted it to someone else. I didn’t do it. And that’s where I disagree with Bob [Mueller].”
The Washington Times reports:
Mr. Dowd said the president has cooperated with the special counsel at an unprecedented level, even providing investigators with communications with the White House Counsel’s office
“There’s no time in history has anybody had this kind of look at communications with the president,” Mr. Dowd said.
