The 2020 election cycle is already in full effect. Trump just finished his first rally on the new campaign cycle in El Paso Texas last night. His speech last night was outstanding. Maybe it was because I haven't seen him in a while doing what he does best. That is talking directly to us, the American people. I think it's that he is hitting his “presidential” stride. Remember how the past two years we always heard how “unprecedented” Trump was in his speeches. He couldn't use a prompter right and always go off course. You don't hear the media talking about this anymore.
 
Look at the past three major speaking events he has done, he has knocked it out of the park. The first was the prime time address he gave during the government shutdown. He nailed that speech. I was expecting him to do his normal Trump speeches and was a little disappointed when he started and I knew I was not getting the off the cuff Trump. Then I heard him speak. I was in awe at how great he did. Then we all saw Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer look like fools in the response to his prime time address.
 
His next speech was the State of the Union. No wonder Nancy Pelosi was doing everything she could to no allow Trump to speak. I knew Trump would not go off the cuff with this speech. But, I would have never expected him to actually get Democrats to give him standing ovations. A CBS poll right after the speech had a 76% approval rating.
 
Then last night in Texas, it was another home run! Trump was in his element last night. His first rally going into the 2020 campaign was a good one. Even at this rally event, he seemed to be more mild-mannered than he typically is. Another big thing I noticed is he spoke of god a whole lot more than he normally does. I am not a religious man at all. I believe when I die, it will be in a deep sleep that I never wake from. But, with that being said, I welcome him talking about god. This country was founded on Christian values and morals and I respect those morals and values.
 
This leads me into where the Democrats are going. They are going so far left they are leaving the middle ground voters left behind. Almost every Democrat 2020 candidate has back Alexandria Ocasio Cortez Green New Deal. This legislation is so radical left, even Nancy Pelosi is steering clear of this disaster of legislation. Hillary Clinton will not be able to run for 2020 because she is not far enough left. Here is the scary thing. Bernie Sanders might not be far enough left for these upcoming Democratic primaries.
 
This all plays well for Trump and his supporters. Politics, just like many other things in life is all about momentum. His approval rating just hit his highest point in his presidency at 52%. As the Dems keep going farther left, Trump's approval ratings should continue to rise and the middle of road voters are left behind by the Dems going far left and Trump being more “presidential.”
