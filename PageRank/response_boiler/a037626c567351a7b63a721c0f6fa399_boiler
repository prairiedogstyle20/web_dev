In case it has yet to be brought to the attention of Meal, Ready-to-Eat aficionados, one of the MRE’s newer bag designs of figures flanking a rifle stack features one individual who bears an uncanny resemblance to the military’s commander in chief.
This is not a stretch of the imagination, not some discovery of the face of the Virgin Mary in a bowl of gravy-smothered mashed potatoes or a subliminal message burned into the flaky dough of a quesadilla.
That is a presidential silhouette if there ever was one, and an unavoidable visual connection that now can never be unseen.
While preparing to wolf down the succulent brown bag goodness adored by generations of constipated service members, a starving D.J. Kremer, an Army warrant officer and barbecue devotee, decided to send his BBQ-loving friends a photo of the blasphemous meal.
“Due to logistical issues, we ended up going three days without food or water," Kremer said. "On about day four, we finally got MREs and I pulled this [MRE] out. I’m a member of BBQ Facebook page, and thought they would get a kick out of me eating brisket out of a bag instead of grilling my own. ... The comments grew. Next thing I know, I’m getting calls from all over saying they saw my post on such and such page. Crazy how quick things spread!”
Reddit user Ternarian then shared the post — captioned with the revelation, “MRE package design looks like Trump and Kanye sitting around a campfire” — on the popular r/AirForce subreddit.
Does it ever.
A warrant officer posted the package to a BBQ Facebook group, ready for some friendly trash talk about eating bagged brisket, but the post began circulating for an entirely different reason. (D.J. Kremer/Army via Reddit)
