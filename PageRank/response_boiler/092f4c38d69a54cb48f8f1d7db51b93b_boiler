Brett Vanderveer had a pretty great birthday Tuesday night.
The Medicine Hat Cubs goaltender stopped all 31 shots fired his way as the junior B team beat the Wheatland Kings 2-0 on the road in Strathmore, taking the opening game of their best-of-three Heritage League playoff series.
The Cubs got goals from Noah Irvine and Tristan Stensrud in the second period, then hung on in the third.
Vanderveer, 19, played in 32 of the Cubs’ 38 regular season games and will likely start Game 2 Thursday night, 7:45 p.m. at the Kinplex. Medicine Hat doesn’t have home ice advantage in the series and will look to advance to play top seed Coaldale in the second round.
Shots were 37-31 Cubs.
