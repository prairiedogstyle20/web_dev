This table lists candidates receiving money from this organization in   2017-2018. The organizations    themselves did not donate, rather the money came from the organizations' PACs, their    individual members or employees or owners, and those individuals' immediate families. Organization totals may include subsidiaries and affiliates.
METHODOLOGY: The numbers on this page are based on contributions          from PACs and individuals giving $200 or more. All donations were made during          the 2018 election cycle and were released by the Federal          Election Commission. Figures for the current election cycle are based on data          released on February 01, 2019.
