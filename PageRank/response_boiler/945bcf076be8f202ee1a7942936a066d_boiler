Austin Prep's girls basketball team found themselves in a typical defensive bout with league rival Bishop Fenwick last Friday evening. The Cougars and Crusaders exchanged leads several times before one of Austin Prep's worst case scenarios occurred — senior captain Jade Finnegan exited the game with an injury. 
The small forward took an ugly elbow to the face and was sidelined with roughly six minutes to go. Both squads battled to a 37-37 tie during the game's waning seconds when Finnegan, black eye and all, returned to the court and got fouled while nabbing a rebound. 
With all of Bishop Fenwick's fans on their feet screaming at the top of their lungs, Finnegan nailed both free throws to seal a 39-37 victory on the road — the first time Austin Prep has beaten the Crusaders in nearly six years. 
"She just understands her role in any given moment," said Cougars' head coach Maggie Reedy. "After she got fouled I brought her over and told her to close this thing out ... she thrives in situations like that." 
Gutsy performances like this aren't uncommon from the Peabody native, considering they've been happening since childhood. While the three-sport athlete also plays volleyball and softball, Finnegan is most fond of basketball and recalled a time where a broken bone made her a better player. 
"I started playing in elementary school," she said. "And actually the year after we won our in-town championship I broke my finger. I figured I needed to learn to use both hands anyway, so for about six or eight weeks I was outside working on dribbling with my left hand." 
"She told me she wanted to try out for AAU teams," said her father Doug Finnegan. "And I was thinking there's no shot she was good enough for that, but I took her to a basketball clinic at St. John's Prep and one of the skills instructors told me she has a better left hand than most boys ... I had no idea she was out there practicing for almost nine weeks." 
The surprises didn't stop there. Finnegan played soccer and was named captain of Austin Prep's JV squad in just her first year. However, during her sophomore year she decided to tell her parents that she wouldn't be playing soccer anymore. Instead, she was going to join the Cougars' volleyball program. 
"I was shocked and I didn't really understand," admitted Doug. Finnegan. "She was such a strong soccer player and I kept reminding her that she never played volleyball her entire life ... they never took her out of the game." 
It turns out Finnegan made an excellent choice: She went on to become a volleyball captain her junior and senior year and helped the Cougars earn their first-ever D3 North championship this past season ... but did so in unexpected fashion. 
Because of her height the two-sport captain was predominately a middle hitter. However, as the Cougars got younger and less experienced the team needed Finnegan to play all over the court and be more versatile --- a request she welcomed with open arms.
"I wanted to make a difference this year," said Finnegan. "We were young but we had unbelievable chemistry and high energy the entire season. We also had a lot of athletes who just enjoyed competing and get after it every single play ... I"ll never forget how high I held that trophy and how awesome it felt to make history with such a great group of girls." 
There's a fine line between an athlete who wants to be great and an athlete who needs to be great for the team, and Jade Finnegan is clearly in the latter category. The difference between the two can be hard to distinguish, but becomes easier when you look at Finnegan's contribution to the school's basketball program.
"She wants to help her team win. Period," said Reedy. "She's just so selfless and never has a bad attitude about anything ... she's always willing to push that extra mile and guide others through challenging times and does so in such a positive manner." 
The Cougars play in the brutal Catholic Central League and stumbled to a 3-7 mark. Since then, Austin Prep has ripped off six wins in their last seven contests (now 9-8) and are just one victory away from securing a spot in the state tournament. According to Reedy, the Cougars massive turnaround is directly related to Finnegan's performance. 
"We had a talk with her and talked about how we need her to be shooting more," said the fourth-year head coach. "She's always been used to setting everything up and having other people score, and it's not an easy thing to deal with when someone asks more of you when you are already giving so much, but that's just how Jade is ... she's been averaging double-digits every night since then and our success has started with her unbelievable play." 
Finnegan's ability to adapt has served her well throughout her senior year so far.
"It was a tough transitions for both (volleyball and basketball) actually," recalled Finnegan. "In volleyball I was asked to be more balanced but now in basketball I'm being asked to score more ... it can be hard having to be a different teammate in each sport, but I do it because I love my teams and I love playing."
The senior is also a member of the National Honor Society, Spanish Honor Society, Austin Prep's Unitas Leaders Association (ULA), works two jobs and holds an impressive 4.3 GPA. It seems like juggling all of this would be downright impossible, but becomes manageable if you have the leadership qualities Jade Finnegan has developed over the course of her young life. 
"She's just a leader through and through," said Reedy. "She'll drop anything she's doing to help a younger player understand expectations or with a certain part of their game. She never hesitates to do anything that's required to make one of her teams better ... she has such a presence that's felt throughout the Austin Prep community."
"If I've learned one thing from my daughter it's to never give up," said her dad. "She understands that if you work hard good things are going to happen ... she always works hard and finds a way to persevere no matter what the situation is ... I'm so proud that she's my daughter."
