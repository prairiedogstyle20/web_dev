Bowling with both the hands isn’t an easy task, it needs dedication. There are few players who have mastered this art. Akshay Karnewar, playing for Vidarbha team against Rest of India in Irani Cup, left everyone surprised when the left-arm medium pacer informed the umpire that he’s going to bowl right-arm off-spin. His two-handed bowling ability showed that Karnewar is an impactful ambidextrous bowler.

Karnewar also played a crucial role in Vidarbha’s Ranji Trophy campaign as they became only the 6th team to win back-to-back titles.
According to a report in The Indian Express, Karnewar’s bowling also left Rohit Sharma and Sachin Tendulkar surprised. Rohit apparently even called Karnewar to the Indian team nets some years ago.
