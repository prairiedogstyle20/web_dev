Robert Swan Mueller III was just named special counsel to oversee the Justice Department’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election and its possible ties to President Donald Trump ‘s campaign. The 72-year-old Mueller has served under presidents of both parties and was the FBI director from 2001 until 2013, when now-fired FBI director James Comey took over the bureau.
Mueller is married and has two children. He was born on August 7, 1944 in New York City.
In his role as special counsel, he will lead the U.S. Justice Department’s Russia investigation. As the Washington Post notes , Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , who said in a statement that Mueller will resign from his position at the private law firm, WilmerHale .
Here’s what you need to know about Mueller’s family.
1. Mueller’s Wife Ann Once Saved Him From a Phishing Scam

During a 2009 speech in San Francisco, Mueller revealed that his wife Ann helped keep him from falling for a phishing scam. As CNET reports , Mueller said Ann then banned him from international banking.
Mueller said he got an email that looked like it came from his bank, but when he started following the instructions, he realized that it wasn’t a good idea. At first, the then-FBI director brushed off the importance of the “teachable moment,” but Ann insisted that it could have been terrible. “It is our money. No more Internet banking for you,” she told him, Mueller recalled.
He shared the anecdote just days after the FBI’s “ Operation Phish Phry ,” when the bureau indicted 100 people in the U.S. and Egypt and arrested 33 others in the U.S. Egyptian hackers were accused of attacking two U.S. banks, using stolen information to access accounts. The FBI alleged that they worked with Americans to pull off the scheme.
“The FBI is both a law enforcement and national security agency, which means we can and must address every angle of a cyber case,” Mueller said in 2009 . “This is critical, because what may start as a criminal investigation may lead to a national security threat. … At the start of a cyber investigation, we do not know whether we are dealing with a spy, a company insider, or an organized criminal group.”
