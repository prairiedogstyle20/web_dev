Missing Mar-a-Lago? Trump has personally paid $50,000 to have a room-sized golf simulator installed at the White House - despite him saying he works 'very long hours'
President Trump installed the $50,000 golf simulator inside his personal quarters in the White House 
Trump personally paid to have the simulator installed in the last several weeks
It allows him to play virtual rounds of golf on any course in the world by hitting a ball at a video screen 
The simulator is said to have replaced an 'older, less sophisticated golf simulator' that was in the White House during the Obama administration
