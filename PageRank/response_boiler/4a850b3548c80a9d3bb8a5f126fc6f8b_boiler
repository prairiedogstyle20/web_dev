Dear Buddy Buckets,
Hello, My name is Ethan Uganiza and I really like you. You are a great three-point shooter and you also have a great handle with the ball. Keep on doing your thing. Also good luck to your team for the rest of the season. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Dear Buddy Hield,
Hello, my name is Jack Shull and I am a huge Sacramento Kings fan and have always wanted to play for the Kings. I have been playing basketball so I can hopefully be as good as you one day. Good luck to you and your team for the rest of the season. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
~ Sincerely, Jack Shull
