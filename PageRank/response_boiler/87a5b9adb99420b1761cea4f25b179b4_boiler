The Bruins secured the Far West league title Tuesday night when they defeated the Cascade Christian Challengers at 67-41.
“I didn’t see that one coming,” Bruins coach Chris Schofield said. “I didn’t think we’d put a beating like that on them. Ours young kids deserve s lot of the credit. They came out with a lot of energy and out senior leadership did great.”
A strong 20 points put the Bruins ahead in the first quarter as the Challengers trailed behind at 12 points. The Bruins never faltered, outscoring the Challengers again in the second quarter at at 15-9, taking things to 35-21 going into the second half.
The Bruins reasserted their dominance in the second half with another 20-point quarter with the Challengers managing half that 10. Starting the third quarter at 55-31, the Bruins ended the game with the same momentum they started with, scoring 12 points and keeping the Challengers at 10 once again.
Tuesday’s top scorer was Lexi Schofield at 23 points from a trio of three-pointers, four two-pointers and six free throws. Next best was Sidney Alexander at 14 points followed by Lexer Murray and Chloe McCrae at seven each.
The Bruins wrap up league play at 8-2 as league champions. They are 13-8 overall and were last ranked No. 10 in the OSAA 3A rankings. Rankings will freeze on Saturday and the Bruins first playoff opponent will be chosen afterwards. Thanks to their first place spot, the Bruins will play the first round at home.
Before playoffs however, the Bruins are looking for a couple extra games to round out their season. On Saturday, weather permitting, they travel Ashland for a non-league game at 1 p.m.
“I want to get one more game Monday, but it’s hard to tell since everyone’s still in their seasons,” Schofield said.
Tuesday was also senior night, with the Bruins saying goodbye to graduating seniors Mickey Fulton and Chloe McCrae.
