Please select your desired egg filling from the drop down menu. Choices are:
1 - Paper confetti only - This is biodegradable and safe for outdoor use.
2 - Paper confetti and dry rice - This is also biodegradable and safe for outdoor use. We have read that rice is perfectly safe for wildlife. The rice may be white or dyed with food safe coloring.
3 - Paper confetti, rice and plastic/metallic confetti aka the works - This is best used indoors or in an area where cleanup can be done so that the wildlife cannot consume the plastic/metallic confetti. the paper and rice are biodegradable but the plastic/metallic confetti is not so please keep that in mind if choosing this option.

Before placing my order, I contacted the shop to make sure there was enough time to get my order before my gender reveal party. The shop owner made me feel like we were in good shape. She created a custom listing where I would pay extra shipping and everything was going smoothly. 4 days after my event the package arrived...Looking back, she didn’t say it was guaranteed delivery but never said it wasn’t either. The conversation seemed misleading. I assumed that since I was paying extra for shipping that it was for some sort of expedited shipping. I contacted the shop owner and she just said it was out of her hands. There was definitely a miscommunication during ordering and I wouldn’t have agreed to the order had I known it wasn’t guaranteed delivery...I would have even paid more than I did to get it on time.

Hi Meagan. As you stated I did NOT guarantee a delivery date. I did guarantee a ship date and I shipped 1 day early since you ordered last minute. It is unfortunate when a postal delay takes place. As soon as you contacted me letting me know of the delay I got in touch with the postal service, got the order moving and delivered a few days later. When you did not contact me after delivery I assumed you were happy. 2 weeks after delivery you contacted me and I gave you the option of returning the eggs unused and I would refund you the order amount minus shipping charges. You never responded and waited almost another 2 weeks to leave this review. There was no misleading and no miscommunication. You ordered last minute, I shipped early, there was a postal delay beyond my control and you did not wish to return for a refund.

These worked out perfectly for our gender reveal!  We had a very specific request and it was met perfectly!

The eggs were great! Everyone asked me where I got them. I used them for a gender reveal where my 2 kids slammed them on a table waiting for the color.

Absolutely perfect and what we needed for my friend’s gender reveal! We did 11 eggs filled with white confetti and 1 egg filled with pink for the reveal. It’s a GIRL 
