Donald Trump Jr has taken an unprecedented shot at 'loser teachers' who he has claimed are trying to indoctrinate socialism to children.
Speaking ahead of his father's rally in El Paso, Texas, Trump Jr whipped up supporters into a frenzy before Trump promoted plans for his border wall.
During his speech Trump Jr criticised teachers and told 'young conservatives' to 'keep up that fight' and 'bring it to your schools.'
The 41-year-old said: 
You know what I love? I love seeing some young conservatives, ’cuz I know it’s not easy.
Keep up that fight, bring it to your schools. You don’t have to be indoctrinated by these loser teachers that are trying to sell you on socialism from birth. You don’t have to do it.
Trump Jr's unprovoked comment drew the ire of teachers on social media who were outraged that a man in his position would not only lash out at them but also brand them losers.
Is this a new GOP slogan?
Kionne McGhee, a Democratic member of the Florida House of Representatives, whose wife is a teacher was particularly critical in his response to Trump Jr's words.
This image also looks a little awkward now.
