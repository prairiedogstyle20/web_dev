AAAS chief admits scientists have destroyed the credibility of science
Below is a fundraising email just received from Rush Holt, president of the Americans Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). As Holt notes (see highlighted section), scientists are so untrustworthy that, well, no one trusts them. JunkScience.com has been pointing out this untrustworthiness for 23 years. Unfortunately, Holt believes the way to repair the reputation of science is to enrich the AAAS so it can lobby Congress for more money for its members. Organized science has become little more than organized crime, where the science mafia steals from taxpayers to fulfill a variety of anti-science, anti-American and immoral agendas. Eisenhower warned of this problem in 1961. The only way to fix it is to get government out of science.
