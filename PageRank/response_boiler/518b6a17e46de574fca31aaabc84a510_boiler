Left to Right: Donald Trump Jr. speaking in 2012 with Baltic International Bank founder Valeri Belokon. El Chapo headed the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico, who sent hundreds of millions of dollars through Baltic International Bank
Baltic International Bank confirmed that Donald Trump Jr. collaborated with them one time in 2012.
But they denied any transactions showing their bank laundering money in a written statement last month.
Their denial is a lie.
It’s the only item published by Baltic International Bank’s account on Medium , which you can see below.
Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project reporters examined the Baltic International Bank account records and transactions related to money laundering for the Sinaloa Mexican drug cartel led by El Chapo.
The OCCRP also found detailed transactions showing that Baltic International Bank collaborated with Prevezon Holdings, the Cyprus company linked to the infamous Magnitsky case.
The bank confirms that Donald John Trump Jr. spoke at Baltic International Bank’s “Inheriting a Family Business and Raising the New Generation” conference in 2012.
Only one year earlier, Wachovia Bank was caught in a racket working to money launder $378 billion dollars for the Mexican Sinaloa drug cartel, run by the infamous El Chapo.
A whistleblower broke the case from London.
Wells Fargo paid out $160 million dollars in what was then the largest fine in US banking history, after buying Wachovia when it failed.
Baltic International Bank was directly implicated to the money laundering crime by US and Australian authorities.
They held a dummy account for the New Zealand company Tormex, Ltd. which was founded by a company mill, directed by a cutout in the Seychelles Islands.
Tormex opened a Baltic International Bank account in Latvia using the credentials of a Moscow driver named Albert Maslakov, who sold his passport information and signed a power of attorney for just a few hundred dollars.
Hundreds of millions of dollars flowed through the account.
Shortly thereafter, HSBC was also charged in a massive money laundering case and paid a whopping $1.9 billion dollar fine.
The Mexican cartels have waged a particularly violent war against their commercial enemies, and some of the families of their victims are suing these money laundering banks in court .
However, that didn’t stop Donald Trump Jr. from visiting Baltic International Bank in 2012.
After the election, Baltic International Bank’s major shareholder Valeri Belokon was implicated in a money laundering scheme in Kyrgyzstan and has been in a series of high profile court cases in the UK.

The same year Trump Jr. visited his Latvian banker friends working for the Sinaloa Cartel, news reports indicate that the cartel has recruited the MS-13 gang as muscle, like this murder in Minnesota . Ironically, President Trump named the MS-13 gang as public enemy number one , today.
Donald Trump Sr. had a very public fight with El Chapo in July 2015, just after launching his run for President of the United States.
It happened just after El Chapo escaped from prison.
In October 2016, reports indicated that El Chapo had placed a bounty on Trump’s head, for all of his anti-Mexican statements.
However, El Chapo was caught again, and has been extradited from Mexico to the United States to face federal drug charges, after having broken out of prison the last time he was arrested.
After the election, El Chapo called Trump:
“The candidate of the most palpable hate, confrontation, racism, persecution and misogyny has won. How sad for us all.”
It’s unknown if El Chapo realizes that his Latvian banker hired Donald Trump Jr. as a speaker.
Here’s Baltic International Bank’s response to my June 2017 report :
Baltic International Bank denies everything.
