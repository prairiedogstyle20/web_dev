What was the purpose of the Trump Tower meeting?
Then To discuss Russian adoptions.
Donald Trump Jr. secretly met a group of Russians at Trump Tower in June 2016, along with his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and Manafort. The meeting wasnât revealed until a series of articles a year later. When the news broke, Trump Jr. put out a statement, claiming, â We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago.â
The adoption issue is closely tied to economic sanctions imposed by the US against Russia after the 2014 Ukraine crisis, and lifting those sanctions is a top priority for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump Jr.âs statement about the meeting, which the President had a hand in crafting, gave the false impression that the meeting had nothing to do with the 2016 election.
Now To get dirt on Hillary Clinton.
The New York Times later revealed that the true nature of the meeting was for the Trump campaign to get damaging information about Clinton , the Democratic nominee. Trump Jr. later acknowledged this and released an email chain showing that he was told that the Russian government wanted to help Trump win and that a Russian lawyer could provide him with dirt on Clinton.
The President eventually admitted, â This was a meeting to get information on an opponent ,â but said it was âtotally legal.â Trump Jr. testified on Capitol Hill that the Russians didnât actually bring any dirt and the meeting was a bust .
