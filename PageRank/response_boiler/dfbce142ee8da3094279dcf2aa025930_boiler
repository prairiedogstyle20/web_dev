In case you missed it, El Chapo, the notorious drug kingpin, was just found guilty and faces life in prison in the United States. The really good news is that we seized approximately $14 billion dollars from the Mexican crime lord. Now, patriots are wondering if President Donald Trump can use the seized billions to build the wall. Well, it’s entirely possible if Trump acts fast. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer should be freaking out. You’ll love this.
Joaquín Guzmán Loera, otherwise known as El Chapo, sat in a New York court on Tuesday looking shocked as the guilty verdict came in on all 10 counts. “El Chapo was convicted on Tuesday after a three-month drug trial in New York that exposed the inner workings of his sprawling cartel, which over decades shipped tons of drugs into the United States and plagued Mexico with relentless bloodshed and corruption,” the New York Times reported.
And that started Americans wondering about the $14 billion dollars the U.S. government seized from the drug kingpin. Enter Senator Ted Cruz, who already took the steps back in 2017 to introduce the “EL CHAPO Act” which would allow all the drug money and assets seized by any and all drug lords to go to building the Southern border wall.
“America’s justice system prevailed today in convicting Joaquín Guzmán Loera, aka El Chapo, on all 10 counts,” Cruz tweeted shortly after Guzmán was convicted on all counts in New York City on Tuesday. “It’s time to pass my EL CHAPO Act. I urge my Senate colleagues to take swift action on this crucial legislation,” he added. But that’s not all.
“Cruz’s Ensuring Lawful Collection of Hidden Assets to Provide Order (EL CHAPO) Act would take any money forfeited to the U.S. by Guzmán and other drug lords as a result of criminal prosecutions and direct those funds toward ‘border security assets’ and the completion of a border wall,” reported The Hill
Cruz reintroduced the bill Jan. 3rd, which means it must pass in Senate and then go to the House, where we know Nancy Pelosi will block it. This is the hard part of losing control of the House to the Democrats. But, the president has a myriad of different options to seize the money and bypass Pelosi altogether.
If Barack Obama secretly sent billions to Iran, Trump should be able to use his executive powers to take El Chapo’s $14 billion dollars, and he wouldn’t have to hide the fact from the American people. Well, how do Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer feel about Trump using his presidential powers to build the wall?
Pelosi is holed up in her Capitol Hill office, freaking out and refusing to make a comment. In fact, ever since the news broke that her cohorts in Congress caved on the Speaker’s claim Trump would not get any money for the wall, the 78-year-old Democrat is nowhere to be found. Congress is offering Trump a measly $1.375 billion in their deal, say reports.
The president responded to this news late yesterday afternoon, saying: “I am not happy!” Then he hinted, “But when I add what I have to add…it’s all going to happen… to build a big beautiful strong wall where criminals, traffickers, and drug dealers don’t get into the country. It’s very simple.”
That left Senator Schumer, who sent his minion Senator Tammy Baldwin to speak out against Trump using any executive powers to seize money to build the wall.
“I think everyone’s clear that’s going to get litigated, not the question of whether his opinion of an emergency is the same as other people’s but we will rue the day when we let a president start taking money for one purpose, declaring an emergency and using it for another,” she said.
Well, too bad for the Democrats, the American people are on board. “Please use the billions of dollars seized from drug lord El Chapo to build the wall. NBC news tonight showed a room full of money seized. What happens to this money. Good way to get Mexicans to pay for it,” tweeted Carol Williams.
Twitter user “Andrew” posted, “I really hope we use El Chapo’s confiscated 14 billion to build the wall so we can rub it in liberals faces that Mexico paid for it. Using confiscated drug money to build a wall to stop drugs coming in…genius!!”
Democrats are livid on social media at the notion that Trump may pull a Barack Obama, but this time the money is going to build the wall, not to the Iranian Mullahs. There is no coherent argument against building a border wall to protect our national sovereignty.
The leftists claim it’s immoral. Walls aren’t immoral, but sitting idly by as our fellow Americans are murdered by illegal felons who freely come and go across our non-existent border surely is immoral. Let’s make sure President Trump knows we are all behind him seizing the drug money and building the wall. That would be the perfect way to use that blood money.
