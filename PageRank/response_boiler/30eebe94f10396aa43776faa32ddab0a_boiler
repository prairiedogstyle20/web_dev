The Russian government lashed out at U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration over foreign sanctions, the Russian Embassy in the United States revealed on Tuesday.
The report comes from a Kremlin read-out of a telephone call between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
“Lavrov called on his US counterpart to forego plans to impose additional sanctions on Moscow over the Skripal case,” the embassy claimed.
Former Russian Intelligence Agent Sergei Skripal, who turned on the government, was the target of an assassination attempt using the nerve agent Novichok in the United Kingdom. The Russian government has been accused of orchestrating the attempt on his life.
“In connection with the US intention announced by the Secretary of State to impose additional sanctions against Russia under the completely unproven excuse of last year’s shady history of ‘poisoning’ of S. Skripal and his daughter, who have not been seen since then, S.V. Lavrov stressed that this unjustified move by Washington will only aggravate the situation in bilateral relations and the atmosphere on the global stage” the embassy said in a statement.
