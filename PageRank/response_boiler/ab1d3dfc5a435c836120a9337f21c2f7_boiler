English club, Chelsea, are reportedly considering making a move for the former Spanish club manager, Zinedine Zidane as a replacement for their current manager, Maurizio Sarri.
The need to sign the French Manager was justified after Chelsea was schooled 6 – 0 by Manchester City on Sunday and slid to the sixth place on the League’s table.
In accordance to The Sun UK, Sarri is running out of supporters as talks have started this week over when the move should be made for French manager Zinedine Zidane.
Zidane has been out of work since stepping down from his role after winning three straight Champions League cup with Real Madrid.
