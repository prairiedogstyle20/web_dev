Tuesday in a press conference, President Donald Trump came up with the idea of having a parade and fireworks on or around the Fourth of July holiday. He seemed incredibly pleased with himself for the ingenious idea he felt he created but Rachel Maddow laughed hysterically.
Showing video of the fireworks and parade that happens in Washington, D.C. every year, Maddow asked how Trump managed to not notice that Independence Day was already a thing Americans have done for years. He didn’t invent it.
“There is the Washington Monument on the National Mall,” she said showing video of the fireworks exploding behind the monument. “As the nation’s capital Fourth of July is a kind of a meta holiday, right? It’s a bigger deal there than everywhere else in the country — and it’s a pretty big deal everywhere in the country — but it’s the nation’s capital. Every Fourth of July there is a fireworks thing in D.C. And parade from downtown with, you know, bands and an Uncle Sam guy and the drum and all the rest of it.”
Today, the president thought he had a brilliant idea.
“President Trump told reporters at the White House he is considering a new idea that has just occurred to him, a new idea for America which is that he is thinking over, he is considering that maybe from here on out there should be a parade and fireworks in Washington D.C.,” she said. “Every year on July 4th. How about that? He mused about this idea to reporters today.”
Trump told reporters in the cabinet room Tuesday, “We’re thinking about doing something that will perhaps become a tradition.” He then proceeded to propose fireworks on the holiday, “even in D.C.”
Maddow wondered if he would then invent a game with a stick and a ball and players running around bases.
“The president will soon come up with a name for that and announce he’s invented this also he’s invented rap music and the idea of taking a vacation in the summer if you’re a school kid,” she continued. “I mean, I kid you not, the president today proposed to reporters in all seriousness from the White House that he’s thinking there should maybe be fireworks and a parade on the Fourth of July in Washington D.C. It could catch on, could become a tradition.”
