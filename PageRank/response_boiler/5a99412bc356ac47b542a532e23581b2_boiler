Georgia Tech junior Luke Schniederjans, a former Harrison High School standout, was one of 28 college golfers named to the watch list for the Ben Hogan Award on Wednesday.
The watch list for the award, named after the late golf legend and nine-time major champion, will be culled to a list of 10 semifinalists on April 17, with three finalists determined May 2. The winner will be announced May 20, prior to the PGA Tour’s Charles Schwab Challenge in Fort Worth, Texas.
Schniederjans was joined on the watch list by the likes of Georgia Tech teammate Tyler Strafaci, Georgia Southern’s Steven Fisk and Georgia’s Trent Phillips.
The watch list is nothing new to the Schniederjans family. Older brother Ollie, the former top-ranked amateur and now PGA Tour player, was a semifinalist for the Hogan Award in 2014 and ’15 and a finalist in 2014.
Luke Schniederjans, ranked No. 8 in the current Golfstat national rankings, leads Georgia Tech thus far with three top-10 finishes and a 69.08 stroke average.
As a sophomore, Schniederjans made the all-Atlantic Coast Conference team, totaling six top-20 finishes and a 71.67 stroke average. That followed a standout freshman season in which he was named all-ACC and won two events, including his college debut at the Carpet Capital Collegiate in Rocky Face.
