// Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk blasted freshman New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez 's Green New Deal Wednesday on Fox & Friends , calling it a "gift to President Trump."
The resolution, which aims to combat climate change, has been widely scrutinized over its promises like eliminating air travel and providing financial support to those "unwilling to work."
The proposal has been endorsed by many top 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said this week that the Senate will vote on the Green New Deal to force Democrats to go on the record about it.
Millennial Politics founder Nathan Rubin argued that "there is no other bill" on the table regarding climate change, and that it's best to try it out even if it fails.

"That's a horrible argument," Kirk replied. "This is the Democrat Party's platform? To try to have regressive policies that will make us less competitive internationally and destroy our energy superiority internationally? It's somewhat laughable and at the same time, I find it kind of scary."
Rubin countered by saying that renewable industry fields are the fastest-growing in the U.S. economy, and that climate change should not be ignored.
Kirk called the resolution "regressive" and that he cannot wait for the Senate to vote on it.
"This is a gift to President Trump and for us conservatives," he said.
