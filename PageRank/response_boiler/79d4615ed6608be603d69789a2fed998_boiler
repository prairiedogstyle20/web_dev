Some superintendents and coaches have been pining to establish separate high school sports playoffs for public schools and private schools, and a state lawmaker is aiming to make it happen.
State Rep. Scott Conklin, a Centre County Democrat, plans to introduce a bill that would create separate playoffs for public schools and private schools. He will discuss the bill at a news conference at the Penn Stater Hotel and Convention Center in State College Thursday night.
Some public school leaders have said the current system is unfair because private and parochial schools arenât confined by geographic boundaries to recruit top players, while public schools must stay within their own area. As a result, some parochial and private school programs have emerged as powerhouses that are dominating state playoffs, public school leaders say.
The Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association, the governing body that operates all state championship tournaments, has resisted calls to change the playoff system. The PIAA has maintained that a 1972 state law requires private schools and charter schools access to state playoffs with public schools.
The issue is a hot topic in scholastic sports. Last July, more than 150 school officials gathered in State College to talk about leaving the PIAA because they are so frustrated over the situation. Most of those who attended said they favored separate playoffs for public programs and private or charter schools.
Public schools and PIAA officials met in November to talk about the issue. Nothing was settled, although some school leaders said the fact that discussions took place was a sign of progress.
In a December 2018 letter to public school officials, the PIAA wrote , âThe Board recognizes competitive fairness issues exist, but also believes there are alternatives to segregated tournaments.â
Conklin was unavailable for comment Wednesday.
