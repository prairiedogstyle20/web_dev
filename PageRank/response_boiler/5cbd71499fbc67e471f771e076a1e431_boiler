Early Wednesday morning, President Trump took to his favorite social media platform to celebrate the conclusion of the Senate Intelligence Committee’s investigation into allegations of “collusion” between the Trump campaign and Russia.
As NBC News reported Tuesday, after two years and some 200 interviews, the Senate Intelligence Committee is finally wrapping up its “collusion” investigation and — according to both Republicans and Democrats on the committtee — they’ve uncovered “no direct evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.”
“The Senate Intelligence Committee: THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA!” Trump tweeted early Wednesday morning.
Tuesday night, Trump gave a big “thank you” to MSNBC for actually reporting on the committee’s findings.
“There is no factual evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia,” Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Richard Burr (R-NC) told NBC Tuesday. Last week, Sen. Burr told reporters that the committee knew the investigation was coming to a close because they’ve run out of questions to answer, NBC notes.
“We know we’re getting to the bottom of the barrel because there’re not new questions that we’re searching for answers to,” Burr told CBS Thursday. “What I’m telling you is that I’m going to present, as best we can, the facts to you and to the American people. And you’ll have to draw your own conclusion as to whether you think that, by whatever definition, that’s collusion.”
Attempting to spin the findings of the committee in a way that doesn’t totally undermine the “Russia collusion” narrative, NBC has made sure to emphasize skeptical responses from Democrats, like ranking committee member Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, who said, “there’s never been a campaign in American history … that people affiliated with the campaign had as many ties with Russia as the Trump campaign did.” Another anonymous Democrat told NBC, “We were never going to find a contract signed in blood saying, ‘Hey Vlad, we’re going to collude.'”
But the reality is, as even NBC admits, Democrats on the committee have been forced to acknowledge that there’s simply no evidence of “collusion”; instead, Democrats are left with pointing to what they deem to be a “pattern” of Russia contacts among some Trump associates and the WikiLeaks’ Clinton email dump, which ended up probably helping Trump some in the election, as “evidence” of the alleged conspiracy.
As the Daily Wire pointed out Tuesday, as the reports from the Senate Intelligence Committee have been streaming in, and after his strong State of the Union Address, Trump’s approval rating has climbed notably. On Monday, he enjoyed his highest approval rating in months, reaching 52%, according to Rasmussen, a fact the president celebrated on Twitter:
On Wednesday, his approval stood at 50%. Rasmussen reports:
The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Tuesday shows that 50% of Likely U.S. Voters approve of President Trump’s job performance. Forty-eight percent (48%) disapprove.  The latest figures include 37% who Strongly Approve of the job Trump is doing and 40% who Strongly Disapprove. This gives him a Presidential Approval Index rating of -3.
