Goal of Oilers is to win and scoring from other sources would help
An opponent said his antics were better suited on the soccer pitch – or the circus – than the hockey rink. But Maxime Comtois, who received a two-minute penalty for embellishment in Monday’s game against Russia, said he was unbothered by criticism that he was not playing “the Canadian way.”
“I get cross-checked a lot and that’s going to happen,” Comtois said of being called for diving. “We’re Team Canada, we have targets on our backs. We’re going to get slashed at tomorrow and as the tournament goes on. We just have to play hard.”
While Comtois has been dishing out plenty of hits, he’s been just as effective in drawing penalties – whether warranted or not.
Against Switzerland, he suckered Philipp Kurashev into taking a cross-checking penalty by dropping to his knees at the slightest contact. And he did the same to Martin Necas of the Czech Republic on a play that Comtois made look far worse than it was.
According to Comtois, he’s receiving far more than is being called. So if he has to embellish some of the damage to get a call, then so be it.
“We’re just trying to have an edge on every team,” he said. “Those kind of things are going to happen. You just have to be careful with that.”
Indeed, after being called for diving, it’s clear the referees are paying the wrong kind of attention to Comtois. It’s something that Canada’s head coach Tim Hunter is well aware of.
“I talk to Max every day,” said Hunter. “He understands the nuances of taking penalties and drawing penalties. I’m not going to talk to him about embellishment. He understands how it went last night.”
KEEP YOUR HEAD UP
Canada lost against Russia on Monday night, but looking back the team had lots of reasons to be happy with how it played.
For one, Canada had outshot 13-4 in the second period. And while the Russians had scored the only goal in the third period, it was Canada that might have had the best chances.
” We didn’t play as great in the first period, but it’s never as bad as it seems when you see it again,” said Hunter. “You look and they didn’t have a scoring chance in the second period. But it’s consistency. As a coach you’re disappointed about last night, but you’re by no means upset because there’s still growth going on here.
“You have to give them the benefit that they are growing. We lost last night, but it’s not the end of the world. We forge on.”
POWER OUTAGE
Canada’s power play remains a work in progress. The team failed to capitalize on three man-advantage opportunities against Russia on Monday, but Hunter said the opportunities were there for the team to score.
“We had some good looks yesterday,” said Hunter. “A couple of great opportunities with the goalie out. We just didn’t connect. It’s a fine line when you’re losing.”
When asked if the team can build upon that for its game against Finland, which has been in the penalty box for 58 minutes – third-most in the tournament – Hunter said each opponent’s penalty kill is different.
“It’s always a battle in what you’re going to do when you look ahead to the penalty kill,” said Hunter. “That’s how you manage and make small adjustments with your power play.”
HOME-ICE ADVANTAGE
It’s not just the crowd that will be in Canada’s corner for its game against Finland. According to head coach Jussi Ahokas, the referees are also giving Canada an edge when it comes to calling penalties.
“I’ve seen it and there’s been lots of times when Canada knows what to do because of the penalties,” said Ahokas. “We have to be ready for that.”
The International Ice Hockey Federation uses officials from the participating countries, but Ahokas suggested there might still be a bias towards the home country.
“That’s just how it’s been,” he said. “Of course, home-ice advantage. That’s how I see it.”
DRAFT KING
With American forward Jack Hughes having missed the last three games due to an undisclosed injury, all eyes have been on draft-eligible Kaapo Kakko. And so far, the top-three prospect has not disappointed.
The Finnish winger, who has played centre back home, has a goal and two assists in four games. According to his head coach, he’s on track to following Winnipeg’s Patrik Laine and Montreal’s Jesperi Kotkaniemi in the NHL one day.
“He’s going to be a great NHL player in a year or two,” said Ahokas. “I think he has all the skill in the world to be a great player.”
