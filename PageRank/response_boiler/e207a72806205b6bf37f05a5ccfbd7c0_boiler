Twitter followers piled on Donald Trump Jr. after he repeated his father’s astounding lie that only 200 to 300 people attended former Rep.  Beto O’Rourke ’s dueling rally in El Paso , Texas, on Monday night. News outlets’ estimates for attendance at O’Rourke’s rally ranged from 7,000 to  15,000 .
El Paso Fire Department officials said there was a capacity crowd of 6,500 in the El Paso County Coliseum, where President Donald Trump spoke, though overflow attendees outside could have raised the number as high as 10,000, reported the El Paso Times .
At one point during his speech Monday, the president boasted that 35,000 people were at his rally. He also insisted that 69,000 people wanted to get in. He said earlier that the fire department had given organizers permission to cram 10,000 people into the coliseum — which fire officials told the Times  was not true .
Earlier in the evening at the president’s rally, Donald Trump Jr. said there were only “50 people” at O’Rourke’s event . But Trump Jr. said that he would be willing to increase that to 200 because of fact checkers, the Times reported.
El Paso officials are furious that Trump Sr. claimed in his State of the Union address that the city was one of the most dangerous in the nation until a border barrier was built. In fact, crime statistics show that El Paso has been one of the country’s safest cities for three decades . The border fence wasn’t built until 2008.
Twitter had a field day after Trump Jr. compared his dad’s exaggeration of 35,000 at his rally to “a few hundred” at O’Rourke’s. Trump Jr. crowed that it was a “really bad look.” 
Beto trying to counter-program @realdonaldtrump in his hometown and only drawing a few hundred people to Trump’s 35,000 is a really bad look.
