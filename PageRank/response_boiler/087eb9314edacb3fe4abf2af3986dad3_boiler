Paul’s full statement :
“I am unable to support Bill Barr’s nomination to be the next Attorney General. While I support President Trump and have supported most of his nominees, I have too many concerns about the record and views of this nominee. Bill Barr was a leading proponent of warrantless surveillance, and his overall record on the Fourth Amendment is troubling to me. I remain concerned that Bill Barr does not agree with our bipartisan efforts to reform our criminal justice system. Finally, Bill Barr has a troubling record on the Second Amendment. For these reasons, I voted today against his nomination for Attorney General.”
More on Barr, via Politico :
The Senate advanced William Barr’s nomination to be attorney general on a key procedural vote Tuesday, paving the way for his confirmation later this week.
The Senate agreed to end debate on the appointment on a 55-44 vote, with three Democrats joining nearly every Republican in voting for Barr.
Although Barr is expected to be confirmed by the Senate in the coming days, he came under scrutiny during his confirmation hearing from Senate Democrats for how he’d handle special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the 2016 election and whether Barr would make public Mueller’s final report.
Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) praised Barr following the Senate vote and said he was confident the attorney general nominee would allow Mueller to finish his investigation without political interference. Graham predicted that when it came to Mueller’s final report, Barr will “err on the side of transparency.”
Ultimately, it appears as though Paul’s vote won’t matter and Barr will be confirmed.
The attorney general of New York is no fan of President Trump.
Letitia James is the first African-American elected Attorney General of New York state. She was caught on video cursing out and threatening the commander-in-chief.
Reporter: “What would you say to people who say, ‘Oh, I’m not going to bother to register to vote because my voice doesn’t make a difference.” Or, “I’m just one person.”
Letitia James: “I say one name. Donald Trump. That should motivate you. Get off your ass and vote.”
Reporter: “Will you sue him for us?”
Letitia James: “Oh, we’re definitely going to sue him. We’re going to be a real pain in the ass. He’s going to know my name personally.”
