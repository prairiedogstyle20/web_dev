President Donald Trump slammed anti-Semitic Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) on Tuesday after she promoted anti-Semitic conspiracy theories over the weekend, saying that her anti-Semitism was "deep-seated in her heart" and "she should resign from Congress."
 
"Anti-Semitism has no place in the United States Congress," Trump told a group of reporters. "And Congresswoman Omar is, terrible what she said, I think she should either resign from Congress or she should certainly resign from the House Foreign Affairs Committee."
"What she said is so deep-seated in her heart, that her lame apology, and that's what it was, it was lame, and she didn't mean a word of it was just not appropriate," Trump continued. "I think she should resign from Congress, frankly."
"But at a minimum, she shouldn't be on committees, certainly that committee," Trump concluded.

Trump’s call for Omar to resign comes one day after Omar was forced to apologize for making anti-Semitic comments over the weekend.
 
“On Sunday, after Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) displayed her blatant anti-Semitism by tweeting that GOP support for Israel was 'all about the Benjamins,' and followed by accusing AIPAC of paying American politicians to support Israel, bipartisan condemnation of her remarks erupted, although no leading Democrats said a word about their colleague’s vile rhetoric,” The Daily Wire reported.
Omar’s comments led to widespread condemnation from politicians across the political spectrum and elicited a response from the Democratic leadership on Monday.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, Majority Whip James E. Clyburn, Assistant Speaker Ben Ray Luján, Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries and Caucus Vice Chair Katherine Clark said in a statement :
Anti-Semitism must be called out, confronted and condemned whenever it is encountered, without exception.
We are and will always be strong supporters of Israel in Congress because we understand that our support is based on shared values and strategic interests. Legitimate criticism of Israel’s policies is protected by the values of free speech and democratic debate that the United States and Israel share. But Congresswoman Omar’s use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel’s supporters is deeply offensive. We condemn these remarks and we call upon Congresswoman Omar to immediately apologize for these hurtful comments.
As Democrats and as Americans, the entire Congress must be fully engaged in denouncing and rejecting all forms of hatred, racism, prejudice and discrimination wherever they are encountered.
 
Sunday was not the first time that Omar has promoted anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.
In 2012, Omar tweeted : "Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel."
The anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Israel has the power to "hypnotize" the world was "the plot of Jud Süss — the most successful Nazi film ever made," The New York Times' Bari Weiss wrote . "In the film, produced by Joseph Goebbels himself, Josef Süss Oppenheimer, an 18th-century religious Jew, emerges from the ghetto, makes himself over as an assimilated man, and rises to become the treasurer to the Duke of Württemberg. Silly duke: Allowing a single Jew into his city leads to death and destruction."
