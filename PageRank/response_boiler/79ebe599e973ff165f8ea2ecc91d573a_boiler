The U.S. Conference of Mayors is defending El Paso, Texas, mayor Dee Margo (R) as he faces attacks from President Trump
Donald John Trump House committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE  for his comments about the border fence's impact on crime. 
"During his rally in El Paso, President Trump claimed that Margo was 'full of crap' because he and other local officials have said that a border fence has not made a difference in reducing crime in the city," the body's president, Steve Benjamin, said in a statement . 
"This is simply untrue. Credible statistics validated by the FBI and other local law enforcement officials show that El Paso has never been one of the nation's most dangerous cities and was a safe city long before any wall was built along the border."

Benjamin, who is the mayor of Columbia, S.C., added that mayors throughout the country "make decisions based on the facts and what we know to be true."
"Moreover, this kind of criticism only contributes to the further loss of civility in public discourse and prevents us from moving forward together to make our cities and our country stronger and more secure," Benjamin concluded. 
Trump on Monday night declared that "people were full of crap" if they said a border fence hasn't made a difference in reducing crime in El Paso.
The comments came about a week after Trump claimed in his State of the Union address that El Paso was one of the most dangerous cities in the U.S. before a barrier was constructed.
"I’ve been hearing a lot of things. ‘Oh the wall didn’t make that much of a difference,'" Trump said while speaking at the El Paso County Coliseum on Monday. "I don’t care if a mayor is a Republican or a Democrat, they’re full of crap when they say it hasn’t made a big difference." 
Margo condemned Trump following his State of the Union address, saying that “El Paso was never one of the most dangerous cities in the US.” 
El Paso was NEVER one of the MOST dangerous cities in the US. We‘ve had a fence for 10 years and it has impacted illegal immigration and curbed criminal activity. It is NOT the sole deterrent. Law enforcement in our community continues to keep us safe #SOTU

He responded to Trump's criticism on Monday by tweeting that his job is "to represent El Paso factually and with integrity, correcting any misstatements negatively reflecting our community."
"I don’t focus on political rhetoric, only facts," he added.

Margo told The Hill on Monday that the U.S.-Mexico border needed "manpower and technology." But he stressed that a physical barrier is "part of a total strategy and process for security."
"It's not a panacea and it's not a be-all end-all," he said. 
Officials in El Paso County  passed a resolution on Monday  stating that the city is "disillusioned by President Trump’s lies regarding the border and our community."
The resolution noted that the county's violent crime rate dropped 62 percent from 1993 to 2007, and that a fence wasn't installed until 2008.
