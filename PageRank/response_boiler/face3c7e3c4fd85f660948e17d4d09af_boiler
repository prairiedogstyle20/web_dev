President Trump mocked Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal as a 'high school term paper that got a low mark'
U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. has lashed out at President Trump after he mocked her Green New Deal during a rally in El Paso, Texas.
Trump derided the freshman lawmaker's "socialist manifesto" as a “massive government takeover over that would destroy the incredible economic gains” the U.S. has made under his administration.
Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal is an economic stimulus concept designed to fight income inequality and climate change that has been met with widespread ridicule after it makes seemingly impossible proposals.
Speaking at the Monday night rally, Trump shredded AOC's Green New Deal, saying it “sounds like a high school term paper that got a low mark.”

Ah yes, a man who can’t even read briefings written in full sentences is providing literary criticism of a House Resolution.
(“Reading the intelligence book is not Trump’s preferred ‘style of learning,’ according to a person with knowledge of the situation.”

Ocasio-Cortez introduced her Green New Deal last week to widespread ridicule

“Ah yes, a man who can’t even read briefings written in full sentences is providing literary criticism of a  House Resolution .”

Ocasio-Cortez is unsettling Congress on both sides of the aisle
Ocasio-Cortez’s  Green New Deal  is widely seen as a litmus test to determine moderate Democrats from the party’s progressive wing.
Among the policies more radical proposals is a promise to provide “Economic security for all who are unable or unwilling to work.”
A 10-year goal to reach net zero carbon emissions was also included, according to a list of  “frequently asked questions”  that had been posted on Ocasio-Cortez’s official website.
The president’s campaign-style rally in El Paso on Monday comes amid the ongoing border wall debate.
Hours before taking the stage, lawmakers reached  “an agreement in principle”  to fund the government and avoid yet another partial government shutdown.
