Everyone will see the Lord’s hand of blessing on his servants—     and his anger against his enemies. See, the Lord is coming with fire,     and his swift chariots roar like a whirlwind.
He will bring punishment with the fury of his anger     and the flaming fire of his hot rebuke.
The Lord will punish the world by fire and by his sword.
He will judge the earth, and many will be killed by him.  (Isaiah 66)
