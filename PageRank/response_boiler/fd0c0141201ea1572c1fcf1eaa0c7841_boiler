Lots of autism and vaccine response. Stop these massive doses immediately. Go back to single, spread out shots! What do we have to lose.

Granted, those tweets are several years old, but a new tweet from Darla Shine, wife of White House Deputy Chief of Staff for CommunicationsBill Shine, has raised the possibility that anti-vaxxer sympathies still riddle the white house. Shine took to Twitter to call the recent measles outbreak by CNN “fake” and dismissed it as “hysteria.”
She then kicked her crazy dial up to eleven and insisted that the Baby Boomer generation all had measles as kids and that we should “bring back” childhood diseases because they “keep you healthy” and “fight cancer.” Both claims are objectively false, and in reality, measles is extremely dangerous.
“The thing that keeps me up at night is having a death, you know, a child die from this,” Dr. Alan Melnick, Director of the Clark County, Washington Health Department told CNN, adding that measles kills about 2 of every 1,000 children infected
For Darla Shine, someone with tangential influence in the White House, to state that measles is anything less than a pressing health problem is deeply disturbing and incredibly irresponsible. Measles kills children, it doesn’t keep them healthy. Vaccines are what keep children healthy. It’s imperative that the White House condemn Darla Shine’s insane tweet immediately before more lives are put in danger.
Here we go LOL #measlesoutbreak on #CNN #Fake #Hysteria
The entire Baby Boom population alive today had the #Measles as kids
Bring back our #ChildhoodDiseases they keep you healthy & fight cancer

Backlash was swift, but rather than back down Shine decided to double down on her idiocy.
I had the #Measles #Mumps #ChickenPox as a child and so did every kid I knew – Sadly my kids had #MMR so they will never have the life long natural immunity I have.
Come breathe on me!
