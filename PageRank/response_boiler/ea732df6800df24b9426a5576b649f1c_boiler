WASHINGTON—U.S. President Donald Trump is usually pretty factual when he is reading from a prepared script.
The State of the Union address last week was an exception. Trump made 16 false claims, which would be low for a long campaign rally speech but is, by any standard, a whole lot for a thoroughly vetted written text from which he did little ad-libbing.

Trump made 25 false claims in all over the course of the week, below average for his presidency. He is now up to 4,350 false claims for the first 752 days of his presidency, an average of 5.8 per day.

If Trump is a serial liar, why call this a list of “false claims,” not lies? You can read our detailed explanation here . The short answer is that we can’t be sure that each and every one was intentional. In some cases, he may have been confused or ignorant. What we know, objectively, is that he was not telling the truth.
