National security adviser John Bolton is considered one of the most powerful figures inside the Trump administration, and the ABC can reveal he's planning to visit Australia within weeks.
Key points:
The visit will come off the back of the President's second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un
The US Embassy in Canberra is so far declining to officially confirm the visit
He is expected to focus on US-Australia military cooperation
The outspoken former UN ambassador was one of the most influential figures behind the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.
In recent years the well-known defence policy hawk has advocated the bombing of Iran and using military force against North Korea.
He has also been a ferocious public critic of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, imposing sanctions on the nation's state-owned oil firm in an effort to force out the regime.
Last year, President Donald Trump appointed Mr Bolton as his national security advisor, replacing HR McMaster.
External Link: John Bolton tweet: "I had a great meeting today with Foreign Minister Payne of Australia, discussing our close cooperation and shared interests around the world.  We have no better friend than Australia."
Sources confirmed to the ABC that Mr Bolton is expected to travel to Australia on the back of Mr Trump's second planned summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, scheduled to take place in Vietnam at the end of this month.
Mr Bolton met Foreign Minister Marise Payne in October last year when she travelled to Washington and has repeatedly said the US has "no better friend" than Australia.
Government sources said the trip was still in the early stages of planning.
They expect Mr Bolton will focus on US-Australia military cooperation, cyber security and China's strategic ambitions in the region.
The United States embassy in Canberra has so far declined to officially confirm whether Mr Bolton was scheduled to come to Australia.
A spokesman for Senator Payne also declined to comment on the impending visit.
