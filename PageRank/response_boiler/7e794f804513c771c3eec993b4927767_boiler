Clinton accuses President of
Chelsea Clinton has blasted President  Donald Trump  for "peddling hate" and called out Vice President Mike Pence for branding Rep. Ilhan Omar’s apology for anti-Semitic remarks "inadequate." 
Although Clinton was critical of Omar's tweets saying "we should expect all elected officials, regardless of party, and all public figures do not traffic in anti-Semitism," she added that Trump apologized "for his embrace of white nationalism & anti-Semitic & Islamophobic hate."

Omar came under fire after she insinuated that lobbyists were funding lawmakers to support Israel.
In her apology, the congresswoman said she had no intention of offending Jewish Americans.
Yesterday, Trump called on Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) to resign after an anti-Jewish tirade that has been widely regarded as anti-Semitic.
“I think she should either resign from Congress or she should certainly resign from the House Foreign Affairs Committee,” Trump said of the freshman lawmaker.
The President called Omar's apology "lame" and said her comments where “deep-seated in her heart.”
On Tuesday, Pence tweeted Tuesday that Omar's comments were a disgrace saying "those who engage in anti-Semitic tropes should not just be denounced, they should face consequences for their words."
The freshman Democratic posted Tweets in Sunday which implied that members of Congress support Israel because 'they are paid to do so.'
"It's all about the Benjamins baby," she wrote, with slang about $100 bills.
When asked on Twitter who she thought was paying Congress to support Israel, she replied, “AIPAC!”
Mr. Vice President- Congresswoman @IlhanMN apologized. She has moved on to highlighting challenges facing McDonald’s workers.
President Trump, a far more powerful person in Washington, has never apologized for his embrace of white nationalism & anti-Semitic & Islamophobic hate. https://t.co/JolA1Yn7Iv

Politico Magazine contributing editor Joshua Zeitz tweeted:
"I'm one of those American Jews who oppose the occupation [of the West Bank and Gaza Strip], laments Israel's anti-democratic drift, and doesn't regard the country as especially central to my Jewish identity. And I knew exactly what the congresswoman meant. She might as well call us hook-nosed."
Omar is well known for her support for a movement known as BDS, for “boycott, divestment and sanctions” which criticizes Israel.
But it is not the first time she accused of anti-Semitism.
Omar says her rejection of the Israeli government refers towards its treatment fo the Palestinians
Omar has expressed regret for tweeting in 2012:
“Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.” 
Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  was accused of supporting the anti-Jewish campaign by Omar before she condemned the comments.
