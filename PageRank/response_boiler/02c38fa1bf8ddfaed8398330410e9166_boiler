Markets have surged on growing hopes that negotiations to end the US-China trade war will result in a truce.
The FTSE 100 reached its highest level since October as optimism over the talks lifted global commodity giants such as Glencore and Antofagasta.
London's blue chip index topped the 7,200-mark during Wednesday trading before closing at 7190.8, 0.8% up on the day.
Markets in Germany and France were also ahead - taking their cue from a rally on Wall Street on Tuesday and a subsequent upturn in Asian trading.
That came after US President Donald Trump confirmed he would be willing to relax the 2 March deadline for a deal between Washington and Beijing, if one is close.
A new round of US tariffs, on $200bn of imports from China, is due to kick in on 1 March without an agreement.
Speaking about the deadline as further talks prepared to get underway, Mr Trump told reporters he might let it "slide for a little while".

Earlier, the White House had called 2 March a "hard deadline".
Seven months of tit-for-tat tariffs has seen the countries place additional costs on goods worth over $400bn in total to date, while the US president has threatened to target all $500bn of Chinese imports.
The main stumbling block has been Washington's demand that Beijing scale back plans for state-led champions in technology including robotics - seen by the US as threatening its dominance and the country's intellectual property.
Economists have blamed the row between the world's two largest economies for driving the slowdown in the world economy.
It has been a major factor behind a collapse in values on world stock markets in the final quarter of 2018.
China's consumption and economy slows
There has been a tentative recovery so far in 2019 though Brexit uncertainty and the recent partial US government shutdown have also helped put a lid on sentiment.
Traders said political progress in Washington on the shutdown issue was another positive for investors on Tuesday after Mr Trump signalled further disruption was unlikely because of a tentative deal with Democrats over funding for his controversial border wall plan.
The S&P 500 closed 1.3% up while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.5% higher.
The mood extended to Asia on Wednesday as China's Shanghai Composite hit levels not seen since November while the Nikkei in Japan was 1.5% up.
