The president then followed up with tweets from the White House. It’s the second time in 24 hours that Trump has brought up animals. He discussed his decision to get a dog to help with his image while at a rally in El Paso, Texas. The crowd cheered on the idea that he should get one, but he was concerned about how he might look walking the dog on the White House lawn.
Some speculated it was a staffer ghost-tweeting for the president, who accidentally forgot to change their accounts.
Whomever is tweeting for trump tonight forgot what account they're using, I guess.

Trump's way of saying he's a cat guy and not a dog guy and putting the dog debate to bed for good? https://t.co/uBzlIoqb5t

Trump just retweeted a short video of two big cats and I'm so confused…
…does this mean we're now at war? Is this a new law? What happens now? pic.twitter.com/wJ6ORMXGS9

But then I remember that his sons kill these magnificent animals for sport.

I think @realDonaldTrump retweet this to show @DonaldJTrumpJr and @EricTrump what to trophy hunt next.
