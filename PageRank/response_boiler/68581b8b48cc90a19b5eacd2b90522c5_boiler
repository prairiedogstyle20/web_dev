Jasprit Bumrah has quickly established his status as one of the best pace bowlers in world cricket. While historically the West Indies, Pakistani and Australian pacers have been the most talked about, the emergence of Bumrah and Bhuvneswhar Kumar, especially in limited overs cricket, has taken Indian pace bowling to new heights. Although many senior players and staff members have helped Bumrah become the bowler he is today, his Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma has had a first-hand experience of his incredible growth over the years.
In an interview with the Times of India, Bumrah addressed the contribution 'captain' Rohit Sharma has made to his career, having helped him groom by giving exposure in the Indian Premier League, much before he made his name known as a death overs specialist for the Men in Blue.
“He's seen me before I was an India player and he's seeing me now. He's seen phases that I've been through. The thing with Rohit is, he's never been different with me. He used to back me with a lot of space then and he does it now. He'll come, ask me what I see or believe in, set the field accordingly and then keeps backing me up all the time. Some days it works, some days it doesn't but it's always so reassuring,” said the 25-year-old.
On the field, Bumrah is seen as a composed character who doesn't indulge in send-offs, sledges and such chatter with the batsmen. When asked whether he makes a conscious effort to not indulge in personal acts, Bumrah said that he discontinued doing it as it deviated his primary plans as a bowler.
"That aggression is there, of course. In fact, when I started playing the game, I used to be really assertive, trying to sledge batsmen, giving send-offs. But then, as I continued playing, I realised, all said it wasn't helping me bowl better. I would drift away from my set of plans, not be able to execute in the manner I thought and stuff like that. That's when I began to realise something here wasn't working. I had to channelise that aggression and let it show in my stride and delivery. Just mouthing off would make no sense. Anyway, if the ball is doing the talking, it's enough. I don't need to talk," he revealed.
Having been rested for the ODI series against Australia and the entire New Zealand tour, Bumrah is expected to make a return against the Aussies in the limited overs series starting February 24.
