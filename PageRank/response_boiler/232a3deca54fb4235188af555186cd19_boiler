Cambridge Analytica began testing out pro-Trump slogans the same year Russia launched its influence operation targeting the 2016 election

CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, speaks during the Web Summit, Europe's biggest tech conference, in Lisbon, Portugal, November 9, 2017.
The Trump campaign-linked data firm Cambridge Analytica began testing out slogans like "Drain the Swamp" and "Build the Wall" the same year Russia began its social media influence operation targeting the 2016 election.
Cambridge Analytica has denied any links to Russian entities or individuals.
The firm attracted scrutiny when a whistleblower said Cambridge Analytica executives met with executives of a sanctioned Russian oil producer in 2014 and 2015 to discuss politically targeting messages toward American voters.
Cambridge Analytica executives were also secretly filmed boasting about how they used shadowy online propaganda tools to help Donald Trump win the 2016 US election.
The London-based data firm Cambridge Analytica was testing out slogans like " Drain the Swamp " and "Build the Wall" as early as 2014, the same year Russia launched its social media influence operation targeting the 2016 US election.
Those slogans would later become the bedrock of Republican nominee Donald Trump's platform while he campaigned for the presidency. He invoked them frequently at his rallies, and his supporters often chanted them.
"We were testing all kinds of messages and all kinds of imagery, which included images of walls, people scaling walls," Christopher Wylie, a former employee at Cambridge Analytica, told CNN . "We tested 'drain the swamp' ... ideas of the deep state and the NSA watching you and the government is conspiring against you."
"And a lot of these narratives, which at the time would have seemed crazy for a mainstream candidate to run on, those were the things that we were finding that there were pockets of Americans who this really appealed to," Wylie added.
Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist and Trump campaign CEO, sat on the data firm's board of directors, which is largely backed by Republican megadonor Robert Mercer.
Wylie said Monday that Bannon's push for the Trump campaign to endorse far-right positions on issues like immigration and law enforcement largely stemmed from Cambridge Analytica's research on those topics.
The Trump campaign hired Bannon in the summer of 2016. Around the same time, it also tapped Cambridge Analytica to manage its data operation.
A Trump aide told Wired that the firm played a "key role" in identifying political donors that helped them raise $80 million in July 2016.
"I was surprised when I saw the Trump campaign, and when it started talking about, you know, building walls or draining the swamp, and I'm remembering in my head, 'Wait we tested this,'" Wylie told CNN.
CA executives caught bragging about winning Trump the election
Cambridge Analytica executives described their techniques multiple times to an undercover reporter between November 2017 and January 2018.
Channel 4 News
On Tuesday, UK's Channel 4 published video footage of Cambridge Analytica executives boasting about how they used online propaganda tools to help Trump win the election.
In one exchange, the firm's CEO, Alexander Nix, told an undercover reporter that he had personally met Trump "many times" and spelled out what the firm undertook for the then-Republican candidate.
"We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting, we ran all the digital campaign, the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy," he was filmed saying.
In another conversation, Cambridge Analytica's Chief Data Scientist Alexander Tayler argued how the firm's work helped Trump emerge victorious.
"When you think about the fact that Donald Trump lost the popular vote by three million votes but won the Electoral College vote that's down to the data and the research," he said.
The news came following a separate Channel 4 report on Monday, in which executives talked about tactics the firm used to push out damaging material on its clients' opponents.
Mark Turnbull, the managing director of Cambridge Analytica Political Global, told an undercover Channel 4 reporter posing as a client, "We just put information into the bloodstream of the internet, and then, and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again ... like a remote control."
Turnbull added, "It has to happen without anyone thinking, 'that's propaganda,' because the moment you think 'that's propaganda,' the next question is, 'who's put that out?'"
Nix denied any wrongdoing in a statement after the investigation was published, adding that executives were "playing along" with the undercover reporter to "spare" him "from embarrassment."
