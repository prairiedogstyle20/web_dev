And so if you like your sports served with a slice of uncertainty, and full measure of statistics, consider the women’s and men’s basketball teams at Laurentian University.
The Voyageurs final home stand over the weekend was a rollicking affair, with double overtime, the slaying of giants (however temporary that may be) and more than 600 points scored between four games.
Here are five other things to know:
That has to hurt
The men knocked off Canada’s number one-ranked team in Ryerson on Saturday night. Laurentian outplayed Ryerson across the board to claim an exciting 88-82 win. Significantly, Laurentian out-rebounded Ryerson 36-31. All-star Kadre Gray scored 45 points and played 38 of the game’s 40 minutes.
On Friday night, Laurentian made relatively short work in a 114-66 victory over Toronto. Gray led the way with 29 points and JD West, a fifth-year guard, was second with 18 points.
After the game, West said they always want to be the team with the most rebounds. “Tonight it was come out, push the pace,” he said.
But really, he said, the main focus in every game is to be the team with the most rebounds. Despite the blowout, Toronto out-rebounded Laurentian 35-34.
There was a defensive lapse in the first half, when it was just fun to be out scoring all the time. Coach Shawn Swords wasn’t thrilled.
“I liked our defensive energy for the first 15 minutes of the game, really good defensive energy. Then they let their foot off the gas because they were scoring,” he said.
Still, he was happy to see the team get their heads in the game. “We aren’t typically able to refocus and play a defensive game. We got it back in the third.”
For the men, the playoffs are assured and they are sitting third.
Jan. 19
The women’s playoff future may come down to a night in January. The women may get a playoff game, but it won’t be at home. Sitting sixth, battling it out with Toronto, they want the final playoff spot in their division.
Laurentian lost a heart-breaker in double-overtime on Feb. 8 as a desperate Toronto, led by Kirsten MacLeod’s late-game, spot-on shooting, took it 83-80.
Emily Tinnes, the fifth-year guard, says they played their hearts out.
“But we can’t let a girl shoot a three (pointer) when that’s what they needed (to score). It’s the focus. It comes down to the little things that cost us. We played well, but we could have avoided that situation and a bunch of others.”
Back in January, Laurentian beat Toronto 61-44. If it comes down to that, Laurentian is likely in the playoffs, if the teams end up tied.
Much depends on how the games go against away this weekend at Carleton and Ottawa. If Laurentian can steal a win against one of those teams – like they did in January against Carleton, then they have some more control over the situation.
“As of now, we can’t get too down. We’ve beaten Carleton. They’re a well-coached team with great players. They’re definitely going to come out hot against us and they’re going to want that win.”
It’s about keeping the focus on what they do best to give themselves the shot at the win, she says.
“When we focus on ourselves and not listen to the noise around us or what other teams do well, it helps us out. So not reading too much into the other team. Being aware of what they do, but focusing on ourselves.”
Shoot for the Cure Night
It was the team’s annual breast cancer fundraiser. Rookies Zoe Hutchins and Maria La Rosa had their hair cut and the ponytail swatches donated to cancer wigs. After all, sport matters, but it’s also part of a bigger picture.
A Mind on Strong Shoulders
When Kayla Deschatelets went up for a layup earlier in the season, she collided with an opposing player and dislocated her shoulder.
Wearing more pink tape than actual shoulder, she is back after a few weeks away and led the Voyageurs with 19 points and 10 rebounds in the loss to Toronto. Laurentian out-rebounded Toronto 56-50.
Support comes from other points, too. While it’s confusing and stressful not knowing the playoff situation, there are things the team has under control, Deschatelets believes.
“I know we put in the work every day. We don’t stop. We started to do mindfulness this year. I think it’s been helping a lot. It really helped with our team chemistry.”
Playing with Giants
Back to that business about being in the OUA men’s east division.
Laurentian will have a home playoff game (Details still to be determined).
Then looking down the road they also have teams like Ryerson, Carleton and Ottawa to watch. Laurentian plays in a division with the top two teams and the sixth-best team in Canada, according to U Sports rankings.
But like, whatever.
For coach Swords, it’s the same every year.
“I just want to get better every game and go into the playoffs with our best foot forward defensively and offensively. Just feel good about ourselves. If we get to that point, where we finish doesn’t really matter.”
Last year, Laurentian lost Gray and West to injuries late in the season. Voyageurs beat Toronto then lost to Carleton. As Swords knocks on the hardwood of the Ben Avery Gym, that was last year.
This remains a whole new playoff picture to draw. On to Ottawa.
