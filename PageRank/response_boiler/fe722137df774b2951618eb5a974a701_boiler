President Trump is  calling on Democrat Representative Ilhan Omar to resign, following her anti-Semitic criticism of Israel.
The freshman congresswoman is facing widespread backlash from both sides of the aisle after suggesting Jewish groups buy support for Israel from Congress.
President Trump said Omar should be ashamed of herself and her remarks. He told reporters Tuesday, the Minnesota Democrat should step down from office.
“Anti-Semitism has no place in the United States Congress,” he stated. “I think she should either resign from Congress or she should certainly resign from the Foreign Affairs Committee.”
Omar apologized for her remarks, but President Trump said the apology was “lame” and her comments are “deep seeded” in her heart.
Several other Republican lawmakers have called on Democrat leadership to remove her from office. However, freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is breaking from her own party and defending Omar.
Unlike this President, Rep. @IlhanMN demonstrated a capacity to acknowledge pain & apologize, use the opportunity to learn abt history of antisemitism,+grow from it while clarifying her stance.
I’m also inspired by Jewish leadership who brought her in, not push her out, to heal. https://t.co/ONRegDJK2S
