Freshman congresswoman Ilhan Omar has been in the spotlight a lot in recent weeks, largely due to the publicizing of her anti-Israel and generally anti-semitic rhetoric. Before she was elected, she hadn’t drawn much in the way of national attention, but now, she has not only set off Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and other prominent Democrats with her reckless speech but President Trump himself.
Watch:
This from Fox News:
President Donald Trump  has called on freshman  Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar  to resign over her controversial Israel comments.
“Anti-Semitism has no place in the United States Congress,” Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting.
“I think she should either resign from Congress or she should certainly resign from the foreign affairs committee.”
The call for Omar’s resignation came after Trump said Monday the Minnesota Democrat “ should be ashamed of herself ”.
Omar apologized Monday for comments in which she implied that a prominent pro-Israel lobby compensated lawmakers for their support of the Jewish state, but insisted on what she called “the problematic role of lobbyists in our politics.”
She drew condemnation from members of both parties after she tweeted Sunday evening that AIPAC has been paying members of Congress to support Israel. On Monday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called on Omar to apologize, saying that “her use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel’s supporters is deeply offensive.”
Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said it was “shocking to hear a Member of Congress invoke the anti-Semitic trope of ‘Jewish money.'” Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., called the comments “deeply disappointing and disturbing.”
However, the apology is not enough for some lawmakers, with Lee Zeldin, a Jewish Republican from New York, describing it as a ‘sorry not sorry’ apology.

President Trump raised the bar of our foreign relations with Israel to new heights when he moved the embassy to Jerusalem, and I’m glad to see he’s staying true to that position. I also agree that the anti-semites that have infiltrated into Congress certainly have no business being in any kind of sensitive foreign relations committees or other similar positions.
