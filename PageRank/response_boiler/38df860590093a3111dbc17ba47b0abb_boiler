NBC News' intelligence and national security reporter Ken Dilanian reports that the Senate Intelligence Committee has come to a bipartisan conclusion that there is no direct evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.
KEN DILANIAN, NBC NEWS INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: Hallie, after two years and after interviewing more than 200 witnesses, the Senate Intelligence Committee has not uncovered any direct evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. That's according to sources on both the Republican and the Democratic side of the aisle, Hallie, and careful viewers and readers will note that Senate Richard Burr, the chairman of the intelligence committee who loads this probe, essentially said that in an interview with another network last week, but what I've been doing since then is checking with my sources on the democratic side to understand the full context of his remarks because that was essentially a partisan comment from one side, but this is a bipartisan investigation and what I found is that the Democrats don't dispute that characterization.
The disagreement comes, though, over the pattern of contacts we've all seen and heard about over the last few years, more than 100 contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russians. The Democrats say that those are â those remain highly suspicious and that thereâs a pattern that still raises questions. But the Republicans say we don't know in the end what those were, and Richard Burr said publicly look, the motives for those are unclear. We may end up with a report that says you decide, American public, whether there was collusion. Another important fact here, Hallie, is that they are nearing the end of this investigation, we are told. But that once they interview their final witness, it will take another six or seven months to prepare a report. The American public may not see the fruits of this for some time...
They are nearing the end of their fact gathering process. Richard Burr said that. My sources are confirming. There aren't that many witnesses left to interview for senate investigators. But after they conclude that, then they're going to sit down and write their report and the Democrats say this report will not be good for Donald Trump. It will question the judgment of many people in the Trump orbit for having the meetings and allowing themselves to be preyed upon by a Russian intelligence operation that sought to interfere in the election and to help Donald Trump. But, again, no direct proof of a conspiracy.
