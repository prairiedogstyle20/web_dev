This is what I wrote yesterday about his comments regarding the accusations against Kavanaugh:
You sorry example of a man! How dare you! You know absolutely NOTHING about being a young girl and being assaulted. The self-blame and recriminations are just about enough to drive a girl over the edge. I know, I’ve been there.
Girls, especially all those years ago, have had an almost impossible time of accusing someone of sexual assault and being believed and not blamed for the man’s behavior.
A female who has been sexually assaulted, is raped over and over again. First, is the actual rape. Then comes the self-recrimination of “did I lead him on?” “did I do this to myself?” Then comes the shame and the attempts to tell someone. The shame continues because whoever she tells, will ask the same questions she has already asked herself. So, now there is more shame piled on. Then, if she goes to law enforcement, she is put through the wringer again and made to feel that it was her fault. Have any of you ever been through a sexual assault test at the hospital? It takes hours. Hours of invasion of personal space and invasion of her body, like she hasn’t been through enough.
If it goes to trial, then God help her. She has to tell her story again and again and again. People walk by, talking behind their hands and gossiping about what she did to have this done to her. The shame never goes away – ever. A woman will never be able to forget the atrocities committed against her just because she was a woman and powerless.
Yes, you’ve finally done the unthinkable. You’ve blamed a woman, who as a young girl, you’ve accused of lying over something that I’m sure terrified her.
As a white, privileged man, you don’t know a damn thing about the kind of strength it takes for a woman to come forward about an assault. Look at Anita Hill. She came forward and never recovered from the attacks against her for telling the truth. And it was for nothing.
You are a disgrace and a piece of crap. You brag about what you’ve done to women, you’ve cheated on your wives like it’s acceptable behavior, and you consider women beneath you – that much is obvious.
I don’t wish ill on anyone, but I hope that someday you’re put into a vulnerable position that will do almost everything to ruin your life.
You are the lowest piece of scum I’ve ever had the misfortune to have to listen to. As a man, you’re a bully and full of yourself. As a leader, you’re a disgrace and an embarrassment to our country, to women everywhere – to the world. You’ve done nothing but show what entitled white men can get away with, and you think your behavior is funny.
If I was still in the Army today, I would probably desert before I called you my Commander in Chief. You’re no leader. You’re an egotistical bottom feeder.
You’ve said a lot of horrible things in your term in office, but this is beyond comprehension. Any husband, father, brother, son who would try to excuse your abhorrent comments deserves my disgust.
There is no excuse for what you said. None. And I will accept no excuses from anyone about your comments. You are a sorry excuse for a man and I feel sorry for the women in your life.
This is your defining moment in your presidency. This is what I will always remember you for, as will millions of women. You’ve reached a new low – one I didn’t think possible for you, but you’ve done it.
