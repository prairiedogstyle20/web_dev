The “Executive Time” scandal is still growing.
President Trump is getting dragged by Twitter after revelations by David Fahrenthold and Josh Dawsey in the Washington Post that he installed a room-size golf simulator at the White House in the last few weeks.
The Washington Post revealed, “President Trump has installed a room-sized “golf simulator” game at the White House… Trump’s system cost about $50,000, and was put in during the last few weeks in a room in his personal quarters, a White House official said.”
The White House official said Trump hasn’t used this $50,000 simulator. Perhaps that is supposed to make us feel better, but not many of us have $50,000 to toss at a game, let alone one we aren’t going to play.
They were told Trump paid for this himself, and it replaced an older version former President Obama had installed. So what’s the problem?
Oh, maybe that it looks like he did it during the shutdown he caused, when his administration thought people were exaggerating about not being able to afford food or pay their mortgages because Trump said local businesses would just work with people.
It also looks like Trump, who has spent more than a quarter of his presidency on a golf course , and already has an executive scandal exposed by Axios showing that he usually shows up around 11AM and spends a lot of time tweeting and watching TV, installed it during the shutdown because he couldn’t go golfing and couldn’t go to Mar-A-Lago.
President Trump couldn't go to Mar-a-Lago during the government shutdown, so he had a $50,000 golf video game installed at the White House, likely at the EXACT same time 800,000 federal employees were without pay.

Or, as it's called on his schedule, executive time. https://t.co/oDGfnYcz3U

The in-house golf simulator really does make you rethink our understanding of what's possible during "Executive Time."

Trump has enjoyed 300hours of “executive time” since midterms. https://t.co/eseZOmDZ4J

In the past several weeks, Trump hasn’t played as much golf as he’s used to – but not to worry since he’s installed a “room-sized” golf simulator at WH. The cost: $50K. Meanwhile, executive time consists of 60% of his schedule https://t.co/ARZf3N5z5t
