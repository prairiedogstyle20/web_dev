Conservative MP Ben Bradley’s apology to Jeremy Corbyn for alleging the Labour leader had links with communist spies has been retweeted a lot.
In a now deleted tweet, Bradley made unsubstantiated claims about Corbyn’s interactions with a Czech agent posing as a diplomat.
I fully accept that my statement was wholly untrue and false.
The apology got a lot of people sitting up and taking notice. In fact, as of the writing of this article, it’s been shared a massive 52,438 times – surpassing even Donald Trump’s most retweeted comment for February.
You’ll remember, it was the one where Trump accused law enforcement officials of political bias. The post was shared 52,078 times.
