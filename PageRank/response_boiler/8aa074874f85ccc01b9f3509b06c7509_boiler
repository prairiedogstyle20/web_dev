Military VET’s Dog Named “Donald Trump” Shot Dead
$3,832 of $500 goal
  Animals   GARRISON, MN
Please help us raise money for Randall Thom who’s dog was shot to death because he’s named “Donald Trump”.  The pup was found in a field on February 10, 2019 and had suffered fatal wounds that included four on his legs,  right shoulder and two on his back.  
The neighbor who shot the dog knew Randall was not home and was protesting the Amy Klobuchar event 3 hours away. Donald Trump lay shot and bled out and then froze to death all alone in a nearby farmers field. There is a police report on file.  
Randall is our presidents greatest supporter and has been to over 40 rallies and the founding member of the world famous Front Row Joes. 
Donald Trump will be taken to Jackson River Edge Veterinary clinic for cremation arrangements by Dr Carr, located in Jackson Minnesota.
Randall raises Malamutes on his farm to earn a living. He donates on average 2 pups per litter as Therapy Dogs when they are puppies, they go to Gold Star families and Wounded Veterans with PTSD. Sometime with a $500 gift card included. Here is a news video story that KARE11 featured about Randall featuring one of his pups going to a Gold Star Family:

Randall has daily expenses including HUGE amounts of dog food, Veterinarian bills, property maintenance, snow removal and because all the negative attention his local sheriffs department brought into his life, he will now require several upgrades to fencing, living quarters and security of his animals.
In addition, Donald Trump the dog that was killed was the in-house stud for Randall's breeding business. Replacing him will be a lengthy process and cost upwards of $4000. The loss of Donald has impacted Randall not just emotionally, but financially.

If you intend to withdraw the money, how you plan to send the funds to the parties you're raising money for or use the money on their behalf:
The money is connected to my bank account. I will then, mail checks and PayPal directly to Randall and help him with some online purchases for dog food and vet bills. If anyone has questions, please just ask. I will turn the comments back on for transparency. Please people - if you do NOT support Randall, take your negativity somewhere else. He is in enough pain, and completely devastated.
Thank you, -Melanie
