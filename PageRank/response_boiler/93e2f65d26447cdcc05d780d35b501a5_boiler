Trump’s Approval Rating Soars To His Best In 23 Months At 52%
Twitter
President Donald Trump’s approval rating hit 52% on Monday in a daily tracking poll conducted by Rasmussen Poll.
That number is his highest since March 6, 2017, less than seven weeks after he took office. It has been even longer since Trump’s “strongly approve” and “strongly disapprove” numbers weren’t under water. On Monday, they were at 39%.
Overall, 47% of likely voters disapprove of President Trump’s job so far, which is a low water mark since November 2, 2018.
The high numbers for President Trump come from surveys conducted during the three weekdays following the State of the Union address.
On Monday, a senior Democratic House aide was asked about Trump’s high numbers. He said: “I don’t know yet if it’s horrible, but it sure isn’t good.”
The president often cites Rasmussen as a rare example of a trustworthy poll, suggesting that others are operated by “fake news” outlets that are slanted against him.
Rasmussen’s Monday numbers suggest President Donald Trump could have a majority of Americans behind him and a leg up on his winning position from two years ago.
Trump’s approval had been sliding in recent weeks, reaching a low of 43 percent in the Rasmussen poll. However, his numbers came back on track following his powerful SOTU address.
An average of presidential approval polls maintained by  Real Clear Politics  now has the president at 42.4 per cent.
