NASHVILLE, Tenn.--If you think you keep smelling a skunky aroma in the air that's probably because you really are according to the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA).
TWRA says it's striped skunk mating season and "Love is in the air!" According to the agency, the skunks start breeding in late February and usually have one litter each year. Gestation takes about 62-66 days and a litter of 2-16 skunks are born in May or June.
The striped skunk can spray 10-15 feet and the smell can travel up to a mile away. Another fun fact: the Great Horned Owl is the chief predator of skunks as the odor does not seem to work as a deterrent.
