Shohei Ohtani  wouldn’t change how he handled his elbow injury late last year, continuing to hit for the  Angels  until season’s end even if it meant delaying reconstructive surgery and his ability to pitch again until 2020.
The reigning AL Rookie of the Year is recovering from an Oct. 1 Tommy John surgery with the hope he will be able to bat in the Los Angeles lineup as early as May if all stays on schedule.
