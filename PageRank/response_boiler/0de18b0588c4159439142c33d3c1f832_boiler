Hannity: Hating Trump is more important to Dems than safety of Americans
“For days, Democrats have been up to their old tricks; paying politics trying to torpedo border security talks with outrageous demands… Democrats they want to cap ICE detentions at 16,500? That’s insane,” said Hannity.
“President Trump’s calling for more funding, more resources, more security to tackle the scourge of drugs, gang violence, human trafficking, sex trafficking, and more,” he added. “Democrats are playing pure politics. They seem to hate Donald Trump; that’s more important to them than your security, your family’s security,” he added.
