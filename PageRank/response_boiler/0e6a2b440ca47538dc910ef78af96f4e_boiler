Just days after celebrating an opportunity to hold events on UFC Fight Pass, Hawaii based X1 World Events is now trying to salvage the landmark opportunity that was scheduled to have UFC President Dana White in attendance next month.
 
X1 was set to host an event on March 22 at the Filcom Center in Waipahu, where Hawaii fighters were going to faceoff with fighters from Michigan's Knockout Promotions (KOP) organization. 
 
X1 President Mike Miller confirmed to KHON2 Sports Director Rob DeMello that producers for Dana White's Lookin' For a Fight reality series that airs on UFC Fight Pass have decided to pull out of the event after it was learned that a KOP Promoter had posted racist remarks on social media.
 
MMA reporter James Lynch was first to report that producer's from the UFC program decided to drop the event from their schedule after learning of the remarks tied to the KOP promotion, thus leaving X1 off the schedule as well.
 
According to Miller, his organization and KOP were not affiliated with each other and that the perceived relationship stems from the promotion of the fight.
 
"This is an X1 event. The only mention of KOP was just because I wanted to make it part of the show. Hawaii against mainland fighters, and I got fighters from that organization. So out of respect to them, I just made it X1 versus KOP in the promotion. I obviously did not know about the situation regarding the promoter and his comments," Miller said. 
 
As it stands, there is no current plan for White's reality series to feature the March 22 event, but Miller who is in contact with producers from UFC Fight Pass is hopeful that the opportunity to be showcased on UFC Fight Pass can be salvaged as all or any ties with the KOP promotion has been cut.
 
"I don't want Hawaii and all these fighters to suffer because of somebody else's problem. We had nothing to do with that situation and we're hopeful that this opportunity that we were looking forward to can still come to fruition," added Miller.
 
"We try so hard to build and grow MMA in Hawaii and support these fighters. Overhead is very high here and we just want to provide our athletes the best opportunities possible."
