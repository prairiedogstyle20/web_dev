 
Senator Ted Cruz says Mexican drug lord El Chapo should pay for the US border wall.
Republican Senator Ted Cruz says the United States must build a border wall and make Mexican drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman  pay for it.
Cruz first made the suggestion in April 2017, when El Chapo was awaiting trial. He doubled-down on it yesterday, shortly after Guzman was convicted on 10 drug conspiracy charges in a federal court in New York.
El Chapo’s Criminal Profits Top $14 Billion
Senator Cruz — an accomplished attorney who graduated from Harvard Law School — tweeted:
U.S. prosecutors are seeking $14 billion in drug profits and other assets from El Chapo, which should go towards funding our wall. Let’s pass the El Chapo Act and make El Chapo pay to secure our border.”
The $14 billion the US is seeking in illicit drug profits from El Chapo’s criminal enterprise is more than double the $5.7 billion President Trump wants for the wall.
The one problem is that the US doesn’t have immediate access to those funds and officials don’t know for sure how much they will find.
David Gaddis, a former chief of enforcement operations at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) said that “the hard facts that back up the government’s assertion of the $14 billion figure lay in the reporting of DEA files, but they will only be accessible when they are made available to Guzman’s defense as discovery material during pre-trial proceedings,” according to Forbes.com.
It’s time to pass my EL CHAPO Act. I urge my Senate colleagues to take swift action on this crucial legislation. #SecureTheBorder –> https://t.co/SndC56CiYz pic.twitter.com/5LgBuBSE26

President Trump reacted to Cruz’s proposal on Wednesday by calling it “an interesting” suggestion.

Border Wall Would Curb Drug Trafficking
Ted Cruz says his El Chapo Act makes perfect sense, as it would fund the border wall and stop the tsunami of illegal drugs from flowing across the porous US-Mexico border every day.
“Fourteen billion dollars will go a long way to secure our southern border, and hinder the illegal flow of drugs, weapons, and individuals.
By leveraging any criminally forfeited assets of El Chapo and other murderous drug lords, we can offset the cost of securing our border and make meaningful progress toward delivering on the promises made to the American people.”
 
El Chapo is one of the important drug traffickers ever brought to trial in the United States. His 30-year career was responsible for a massive amount of illegal drugs entering this country, resulting in countless drug-related crimes and deaths.
Having El Chapo pay for a wall to stop drug lords like himself would be poetic justice for this murderous career criminal.
“This trial has pulled back the curtain on international drug dealing in a way that no other trial has,” said US Attorney Richard Donoghue. “Guzmán and his co-conspirators were responsible for smuggling hundreds of tons of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana into the United States.”
MS-13 Laughed How Easy It Was to Cross Border
As BizPac Review reported, the former chief of Border Patrol under Barack Obama said  MS-13 gang members used to laugh at how easy it is to cross back and forth across the porous US-Mexico border.
Why? Because there’s no wall to stop them.
Obama's border chief says Congress could fix crisis in 5 min: MS-13 gangs laugh at how easy it is to sneak into US! Dems ignore the fact that #MS13 gang members prey on other Hispanics! What about their safety?Dems are huge Hypocrites #PaintOurCountryRed https://t.co/TSXTrPt9Pg

Ted Cruz Keeps Beard After Liberals Swooned
On an unrelated but hilarious note, we noticed that Ted Cruz has kept the beard he grew in November after getting raves from liberal women about his new facial hair.
Liberals panted after the Texas Republican, saying his hipster facial hair suddenly rendered him irresistibly hot . And despite their best efforts, they just couldn’t quit him.
“I have no particular fondness for this subject and it brings me no pleasure to cover it. But as a truth-seeking journalist, I feel I must write what follows: Sen. Ted Cruz’s new beard looks great,” the Slate cooed.  The column offered other thoughts on “the unwelcome semi-hotness of the Texas senator’s facial hair.”
But do you know what’s sexier than Ted Cruz’s new beard? $14 billion for a border wall, baby!
I'm not a big fan of beards, but obviously other women disagree. A leftist writer who despises Senator Ted Cruz coos over the unbearable ‘hotness’ of his new beard. 倫 https://t.co/QGPRxc0rLw

“I know it’s very emotionally confusing, but I for one accept the new, hotter Ted Cruz.”
