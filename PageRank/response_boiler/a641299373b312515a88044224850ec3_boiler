Donald John Trump House committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE 's State of the Union address late Tuesday, noting that for all his warnings about threats against the United States, he did not discuss "the gun violence epidemic."
"It will take days to fact-check all the misrepresentations that the President made tonight," Pelosi said in a statement after Trump's speech. "Instead of fear-mongering and manufacturing a crisis at the border, President Trump should commit to signing the bipartisan conference committee’s bill to keep government open and provide strong, smart border security solutions.
“Sadly, while talking about perceived threats to the safety of the American people, he completely ignored the gun violence epidemic that is claiming lives across the country," she added.

The president did not broadly discuss recent mass shootings during his roughly 80-minute speech. He did reference last October's shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh that left 11 people dead, though he spoke about the tragedy in the context of confronting anti-Semitism.
Pelosi, who was seated behind Trump during his speech, provided a visible contrast to the tone of the president's address throughout the night, silently expressing disagreement on a number of occasions. She rolled her eyes and shook her head at one point when the president warned that "ridiculous partisan investigations" could derail the country's progress.
In her statement following the speech, Pelosi hammered Trump for threatening Congress over its oversight responsibilities, and his failure to put forward specific legislation on infrastructure investments. 
“President Trump must now take concrete steps to work with Democrats to strengthen the health and economic security of families across America," she said. "After two years of the President’s empty words, the American people deserve real results.”
