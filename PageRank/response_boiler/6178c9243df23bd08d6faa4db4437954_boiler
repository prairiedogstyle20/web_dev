IIhan Omar on Wednesday pushed back against President Trump's call for her to resign from Congress due to comments she's made about support for Israel on Capitol Hill.
Omar drew bipartisan criticism earlier this week for a tweet critics said invoked an anti-Semitic trope, while accusing a pro-Israel lobbying group of paying lawmakers in exchange for influence.
"It's all about the Benjamins, baby," Omar said, a comment for which she later apologized, after being chastised by the House Democratic leadership.
"I think she should either resign from Congress, or she should certainly resign from the House Foreign Affairs Committee," Trump said.
Omar took issue with that idea in a Wednesday morning tweet.
“You have trafficked in hate your whole life — against Jews, Muslims, Indigenous, immigrants, black people and more,” she said.
“I learned from people impacted by my words,” Omar added in her tweet at Trump. “When will you?”
In her written apology hours earlier, Omar said she was “listening and learning, but standing strong.”
One of Omar’s biggest allies in Congress, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., jabbed at Trump following his call for Omar to resign.
“Unlike this President, Rep. @IlhanMN demonstrated a capacity to acknowledge pain & apologize, use the opportunity to learn abt history of antisemitism,+grow from it while clarifying her stance,” Ocasio-Cortez said.
