President Trump praised German Shepards, but insists he doesn't have time to take care of a dog while in the White House.
President Trump has an interesting pet peeve — dogs.
He called out pup ownership in the White House as “phony” in a bizarre rant during his pro-border wall rally in El Paso, Texas Monday night.

“You do love your dogs, don’t you?,” he asked the MAGA-hat wearing crowd. “I wouldn’t mind having one honestly, but I don’t have any time.”
Trump then painted a picture of himself strolling on the grounds of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. with man’s best friend.
“How would I look walking a dog on the White House lawn?,” he asks, before grimacing and shaking his head no.
“I don’t know — it doesn’t — I don’t feel good,” he managed to get out. “Feels a little phony to me.”
“A lot of people say, ‘Oh, you should get a dog,’” Trump added. “‘Why?’ ‘It’s good politically.’ I said, ‘Look that’s not the relationship I have with my people.’”

Someone in the crowd then yelled out President Obama’s name.
“Yeah, Obama had a dog, you’re right,” Trump said as the audience laughed hysterically.
The Obama family famously owned a pair of Portuguese water dogs, Bo and Sunny. They were preceded by a pack of pups belonging to President George W. Bush. And President Clinton was owner to Socks the cat and Buddy, a Labrador retriever.
In fact, Trump is reportedly the first President in more than a century not to own a dog. He did share his home with one, apparently against his will, when he was with first wife, Ivana. But she called him out in her 2017 memoir, “Raising Trump,” for hating dogs.
“Donald was not a dog fan,” Ivana wrote in the book. She added he initially told her that her poodle, Chappy, couldn’t move in with them in New York. But she told him, “It's me and Chappy or no one!,” and he gave in.
Trump has also used the word “dog” as a slur, calling his former White House aide, Omarosa Manigault Newman, “that dog” last August after she released conversations she claims to have secretly recorded while she was with the Trump administration.
