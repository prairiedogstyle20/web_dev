Concord teenager Yealimi Noh made it official this week in announcements on Instagram and Twitter: She has turned professional.
Erik Stone, Noh’s Alameda-based coach, said she already has played at least one event on the Korean LPGA Tour and another on the Cactus Tour in Arizona. Noh tied for eighth in the tournament in Litchfield Park, Ariz., Feb. 4-6. She delayed this week’s announcement until she finalized her endorsement contracts.
“She’s ready,” Stone said Wednesday. “She’s on her way. It was the right decision for her.”
By turning professional, Noh relinquished her exemptions to play as an amateur in the ANA Inspiration, Augusta National Women’s Amateur, U.S. Women’s Open and Evian Masters. She still can try to qualify for the Open as a pro.
Noh, 17, plans to play additional events on the Korean LPGA Tour, Stone said, and hopes to land sponsor exemptions on the U.S.-based LPGA Tour. One obvious possibility: the Mediheal Championship at Lake Merced, May 2-5.

Noh burst into prominence last summer, when she enjoyed a staggering run of success. In three consecutive weeks in July, she won three national tournaments: the Junior PGA in Kentucky, the U.S. Girls Junior at Poppy Hills and the Canadian Women’s Amateur in Vancouver.
Then, in September, she helped the U.S. win the Junior Ryder Cup in Paris. Noh soared into the top 20 in the world amateur rankings.
Even before those victories, Noh withdrew her commitment to UCLA and decided to turn pro. Now it’s official, even though she doesn’t have status on the LPGA Tour.
In a September interview with The Chronicle, she said she would seek LPGA sponsor exemptions, enter Monday qualifying events and gain experience playing on mini-tours.
“It’s so exciting,” she said then. “I’m ready. I just can’t wait to be on tour. Who knows if I win one (in 2019) after Monday qualifying? Brooke Henderson did that. It’s possible. I’m just excited to see what comes next.”
Noh has endorsement deals with Hana Financial Group and Descente clothing, according to her Instagram post.
