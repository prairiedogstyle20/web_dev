Donald John Trump House committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE Monday evening after the White House and Trump himself criticized the rollout of the freshman lawmaker's Green New Deal legislation.
In a tweet Monday night, Ocasio-Cortez mocked reports that Trump often forgoes reading the traditional briefings offered to him by aides in favor of vocal briefings from advisers.
"Ah yes, a man who can’t even read briefings written in full sentences is providing literary criticism of a House Resolution," she tweeted.

The president during a rally Monday night in El Paso, Texas, likened the proposal, which would steer America's economy toward reliance on sustainable energy, to a "high school term paper that got a low mark."
The White House in a statement  last week said that Trump “has vowed that America would never be socialist, and this administration will fight this central planning disaster,” and called the plan a “roadmap to destroy the American Economy.” 
A United Nations report last year warned that the world was on a potentially "irreversible" path toward a changing climate, and that global organizations and governments have about 12 years to bring emissions under control to prevent a change in temperatures as high as 1.5 degrees Celsius, a change that would have drastic environmental effects worldwide.
