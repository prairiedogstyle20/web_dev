Watch: Libs Pounced Immediately But As Usual They Were Wrong
What’s on everyone’s mind today?
Crowd sizes. I know, I know. I’m not in the mood either.
President Trump has boasted of having a bigger crowd than Beto in El Paso.
Donald Trump claims there were 35,000 people at his rally

However, the El Paso Fire Department said the arena where Trump’s rally was held only holds 6,500 people. Meanwhile, they estimate that 10,000-15,000 showed up to Beto’s counter rally. That’s the current narrative. Libs are taking a victory lap on Twitter.
Here’s the one thing people are forgetting…the overflow crowd. While the arena only held 6,500, there were at least 10,000 people in Trump’s overflow crowd.

I’m just saying… you gotta take that into consideration too.
K– I’m over this crowd size stuff now. Let’s move on.
