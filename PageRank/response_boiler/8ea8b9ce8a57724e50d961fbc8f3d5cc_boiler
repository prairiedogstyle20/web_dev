Freshman congresswoman Omar sparks outrage over anti-Semitic tweet
Chelsea Clinton on Tuesday called out Vice President Mike Pence for saying that Rep. Ilhan Omar’s apology for earlier Twitter posts called anti-Semitic was "inadequate," and blasted President Trump for peddling hate.
Clinton, who was critical of Omar's tweets, posting that "we should expect all elected officials, regardless of party, and all public figures to not traffic in anti-Semitism," but said on Tuesday that Trump is a "far more powerful person" and has never apologized "for his embrace of white nationalism & anti-Semitic & Islamophobic hate."
Omar said she had no intention of offending anyone, including Jewish Americans, when she insinuated that lobbyists were paying lawmakers to support Israel. Trump called her apology "lame" and said she should resign from Congress or at least not be allowed to serve on committees.

Pence tweeted Tuesday that Omar's comments were a disgrace. He said "those who engage in anti-Semitic tropes should not just be denounced, they should face consequences for their words."
The freshman Democratic posted tweets on Sunday that suggested that members of Congress support Israel because they are paid to do so. In a pair of tweets, Omar criticized the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC.
LONG HISTORY OF CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS
"It's all about the Benjamins baby," she wrote, invoking slang about $100 bills. Asked on Twitter who she thought was paying members of Congress to support Israel, Omar responded, “AIPAC!”
Left-wing historian and Politico Magazine contributing editor Joshua Zeitz tweeted: "I'm one of those American Jews who opposes the occupation [of the West Bank and Gaza Strip], laments Israel's anti-democratic drift, and doesn't regard the country as especially central to my Jewish identity. And I knew exactly what the congresswoman meant. She might as well call us hook-nosed."
Omar supports a movement known as BDS, for “boycott, divestment and sanctions” aimed at Israel. And it’s not the first time she’s fought accusations of anti-Semitism. She insists her rejection of the Israeli government refers to its stance toward Palestinians and is not directed at Jewish people.

Omar has expressed regret for tweeting in 2012: “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.” She said the statement came in the context of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
