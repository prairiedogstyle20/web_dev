Actor Chris Evans went after President Trump and his base over a tweet President Trump sent out to Senator Amy Klobuchar. Trump called out Klobuchar for pushing climate change while speaking in a snowstorm.
Article from Fox News :
As previously reported, Klobuchar announced her candidacy, which included tackling climate change, while standing in the midst of a hearty midwestern snow storm. Donald Trump made hay out of the situation with a tweet questioning how real global warming can be given the harsh cold she was standing in.
“Well, it happened again. Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)!” Trump tweeted Sunday.
The “Avengers: Endgame” star took to the social media platform to slam Trump and his lack of understanding of how climate change works before directly skewering the president’s supporters.
“Either you STILL don’t understand that weather is not climate despite literally everyone explaining it to you every time you tweet this ignorance, or you just don’t care, and you’re deliberately misleading your base,” Evans wrote. “Which is it?”
Evans is known to use his high profile to trash the president and those who support him, especially when he disagrees.
