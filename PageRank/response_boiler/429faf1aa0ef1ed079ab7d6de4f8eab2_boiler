Hanoi was the capital of communist North Vietnam during the bloody conflict between 1965 and 1973 which Americans refer to as the "Vietnam War" and the Vietnamese call the "American War".
Since the war, in which millions of civilians and combatants died, reunified Vietnam has rebuilt relations with America while remaining a communist state.

North Korea isolated itself from the outside world after the Korean War ended in 1953, and only began to mend ties with US-backed South Korea in recent years.
South Korean presidential spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said this week that Vietnam was the best choice of host for the next summit because it and America used to "point a gun and knife at each other", Reuters news agency reports.
Vietnam is also seen as a model of economic and political reform for the North to follow.
An unnamed White House official with knowledge of the second summit's planning told CBS News Vietnam had been chosen in part because of its good relationships with both the US and North Korea .
The post-war trajectory of relations between America and Vietnam was, the official added, a hopeful model for potential warmer relations between the US and North Korea.
What preparations are being made?
US envoy Stephen Biegun spent three days in discussions on the Korean peninsula.
In the Northern capital Pyongyang, he met his counterpart Kim Hyok-chol and discussed the "Singapore summit commitments of complete denuclearisation", a US state department statement says.
The two envoys will meet again before the summit. Mr Biegun warned of "some hard work to do with the DPRK [North Korea] between now and then".

In South Korea, the US envoy briefed Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha.
"I am confident that if both sides stay committed, we can make real progress," he told reporters.
President Trump tweeted that North Korea could become an economic "rocket".

North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, will become a great Economic Powerhouse. He may surprise some but he wonâ€™t surprise me, because I have gotten to know him & fully understand how capable he is. North Korea will become a different kind of Rocket - an Economic one!
