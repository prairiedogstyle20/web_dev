U.S. Donald Trump Politics
Four days on from President Donald Trump completing a four-hour physical exam, the White House has yet to release details about the results of the tests. The absence of information beyond an initial short memo has prompted the longtime cardiologist of former Vice President Dick Cheney to suggest that the White House is “hiding” something.
“It’s been 4 days since the president underwent his annual physical exam and still no data has been released. What are they hiding?” Dr. Jonathan Reiner wrote on Twitter Tuesday.

Reiner is the director of the cardiac catheterization laboratory at the George Washington University Hospital and professor of medicine at the George Washington University in Washington, D.C. In 2013, he penned a book with Cheney, titled Heart: An American Medical Odyssey, detailing the Republican’s battle with heart disease. Cheney served as vice president to George W. Bush for two terms, between 2001 and 2009.
Immediately after Trump’s annual exam at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, the physician to the president, Sean Conley, wrote a memo hailing Trump’s health.
“While the reports and recommendations are being finalized, I am happy to announce the President of the United States is in very good health and I anticipate he will remain so for the duration of his Presidency, and beyond," it read in part.
While brief, the remarks will still enough to provoke an angry response from a former Obama administration official.
“No doctor can predict someone’s future health,” Ronald Klain, who also served as chief of staff to former Vice President Joe Biden and led the administration’s efforts tackling the Ebola crisis, wrote on Twitter Saturday.
“This is a disgrace to an office with a great tradition of professionalism. Just another institution turned into a joke by a President determined to make anyone willing to submit an instrument of his lies,” he continued.

The White House did not immediately respond a question from Newsweek about if and when further details about Trump’s physical exam would be released. After Trump’s last exam, a press briefing was held with White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson. Jackson was effusive in his praise of Trump’s health, despite the president admitting to getting little exercise and eating a diet featuring large amounts of fast food.
“Some people just have great genes,” Jackson said in response to questioning about Trump’s glowing report.
Still, Jackson added that he had advised the president to adopt an exercise regime and better diet. Just ahead of Trump’s latest physical on Friday, the White House acknowledged that the president had not followed the guidelines.
“The president received a diet and exercise plan last year after his annual physical, but the President admits he has not followed it religiously,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told CNN.
