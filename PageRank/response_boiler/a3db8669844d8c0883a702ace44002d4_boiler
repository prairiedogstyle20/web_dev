More than 1.4 million households dropped off food stamps since President Donald Trump’s first full month in office in February 2017, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) data on food stamp enrollment released Friday.
The latest USDA data revealed that the number of households on food stamps in October 2018 dropped to 19,410,711, down by 1,428,558 from February 2017 when 20,839,269 households were enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the federal government program which administers food stamps.
The most recent data on the number of food stamp households had also reached historic lows not seen since June 2010 when enrollment in the nation’s food stamp program was at 19,143,572.
Breitbart News previously reported in June — citing the latest available data from the USDA at the time — that food stamp households dropped below 20 million for the first time in eight years. At the time, enrollment among households dropped to 19,992,124 in February 2018 — the first time enrollment dipped below 20 million since September 2010.
Overall food stamp enrollment has also been on the downswing under Trump. Approximately 3,619,048 individuals discontinued their participation in SNAP between February 2017 and October 2018 — the latest data available from the agency.
The downward trend in enrollment among both households and individuals throughout Trump’s time in office is on pace with the slow and steady decrease in SNAP participation since 2013.
And this past fiscal year has been no exception as food stamp enrollment declined every month in fiscal year (FY) 2018.
Using the latest data from the USDA, here is the month-by-month breakdown of how many people overall canceled their SNAP benefits in FY 2018:
October to November: 4,050,688
