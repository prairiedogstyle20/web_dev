On January 3, the same day she was elected as Speaker of the House for the second time, Rep. Nancy Pelosi was asked by gushing reporters if she foresaw "any situation in which you would accept even a dollar of wall funding?"
 
The California Democrat mockingly said she'd give a single dollar for the barrier that President Trump has been pushing since his campaign in 2016. "A dollar?" she said, looking confused as reporters laughed. "A dollar? One dollar?" she said, holding up her index finger and mugging for the camera. "Yeah, one dollar."
The federal government shut down over Democrats' refusal to set aside $5.7 billion for the wall, even though the amount was just 0.13% of the massive annual budget. By the end of January, Pelosi even took that single buck away. “There’s not going to be any wall money in the legislation,” she told reporters at her weekly press conference.
But now, congressional negotiators from both parties have announced that they made an "agreement in principle" on a spending bill — one that includes $1.375 billion for border barriers. The deal includes enough cash for "a total of 55 miles, which is just 9 miles shy of Trump’s last budget request," Politico reported on Tuesday.
So let's do the math: Pelosi said she'd only give a dollar. Trump is about to get $1.375 billion. That means he's getting $1,374,999,999 more than Pelosi said she'd ever give for a border barrier.
You can slice this up any way you want, parse and re-parse, even grade it all on a heavy curve, and there's no way you can come up with another conclusion: Trump ate Pelosi's lunch (even the chocolate pudding).
The once-great Associated Press , now just another arm of the Democratic Party, reveled in the news, spinning the deal as a big win for the party. "The Latest: Budget deal calls for far less border wall money," said one headline.
 
Of the $1.375 billion for the border barrier, the AP said: "That’s well below the $5.7 billion President Donald Trump demanded to build over 200 miles of wall along the Mexican boundary. The money will be for vertical steel slats called bollards, not a solid wall."
But Trump had already gotten ahead of that game, saying on January 31 that Democrats should "stop playing political games" and give up the semantical debate over whether the barrier would be a wall or a fence. "Lets just call them WALLS from now on and stop playing political games! A WALL is a WALL!" Trump wrote on Twitter.
Lets just call them WALLS from now on and stop playing political games! A WALL is a WALL!

After the Senate Democrats refused to vote on a House bill to fund the government — which caused the 35-day government shutdown — Pelosi was pictured dancing in delight (in some ironic timing, the short video clip posted on YouTube caught her bobbing to the song "American Pie," just as the singer sings "I saw Satan laughing with delight ...").
 
Pelosi also taunted Trump last week in an Oval Office meeting before the House vote, saying he couldn't get the wall funding through. "The fact is you do not have the votes in the House," Pelosi told Trump. "Nancy, I do," he said, to which Pelosi replied, "Well, let's take the vote and we'll find out."
The House voted: Trump won.
And now Trump's won again on the border barrier — a compromise, sure, but Pelosi said $1 and Trump got $1,374,999,999 more than that.
So much winning!
