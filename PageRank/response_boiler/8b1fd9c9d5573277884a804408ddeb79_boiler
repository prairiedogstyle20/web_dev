Senate Intel Chief Richard Burr Covered for Trump While Russia Attacked 2016 Election
Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC)—the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election—repeatedly denied evidence of Russian meddling on behalf of President Trump even after briefings from the intelligence community proved otherwise, according to a Wednesday report from Just Security. As a member of the Gang of Eight and the Gang of Twelve—a group of top-level lawmakers authorized to receive national-security intelligence—Burr was repeatedly presented with evidence showing that Russian agents had hacked the Democratic National Committee, were working to help Trump win, and were targeting state-level voting systems. Nevertheless, on Oct. 3, 2016, he told Foreign Policy that “I have yet to see anything that would lead me to believe” that Russia was meddling in the election to help Trump. Just Security adds that Burr was also the only person to join the Trump campaign who was privy to intelligence showing that members of the Trump campaign may have been colluding with Russia.
