Donald Trump Jr. ‘s name is being floated as a potential political candidate but the President’s eldest son just lost one constituency Monday night.
Speaking in El Paso, Texas to warm up the crowd for his father’s “Make America Great Again” rally, Trump Jr. decided to attack teachers, and many Americans are outraged.
DJTJ, as Donald Trump Jr. is often called, is closely aligned with  Turning Point USA , which bills itself as a conservative organization focused on college students. Its founder,  Charlie Kirk , often appears at Trump rallies and DJTJ has spoken at TPUSA rallies. TPUSA’s communications director,  Candace Owens , was accused last week of  defending Hitler .
So perhaps it’s no surprise that the President’s son would focus his attention on school-age conservatives, but his remarks inspired some to suggest he is the one in need of an education.
“You know what I love?” Trump Jr. asked the crowd in El Paso. “I love seeing some young conservatives, ’cuz I know it’s not easy,” he said, reinforcing the Trump family’s theme that conservatives are marginalized victims.
“Keep up that fight, bring it to your schools. You don’t have to be indoctrinated by these loser teachers that are trying to sell you on socialism from birth. You don’t have to do it,” he told the audience.

Many on social media took offense to the President’s son’s attack on educators, many if not most of whom endure low-salaries, are forced to buy classroom supplies with their own money, and suffer extreme disrespect from the right. As  one person on Twitter  asked, “The same teachers who we expect to put their bodies in front of our kids if a shooter comes in their classroom?”
At least one teachers’ union responded:
Donald Trump Jr. called teachers “losers” today. Must mean we’re doing something right. https://t.co/uRLJHgWFrP

The number of people online citing Trump Jr.’s “loser teachers” remark was massive. Here’s a small sampling:
@DonaldJTrumpJr – I am one of those “loser teachers” and I will do more good in the next five days in my classroom than you will do in the rest of your sorry life. You are the broken progeny of a failure of a father. Try breaking the cycle and being your own man. #beBetter https://t.co/kf1Jp2GfkY
-Every single thing he says is an insanity-level lie.
-Don Jr. calling teachers losers is straight heartbreaking.
-SMH right off https://t.co/SRAoxDyJIX

Would that he’d paid enough attention to the “loser teachers” to know whether to use ‘who’ or ‘that’.

Loser teachers. Nice.
I am a first year teacher. I have to buy my own supplies for my students to even have the basics to learn. I am too busy trying to get them ready for the next grade and worrying about where we are getting our next box of glue to indoctrinate them.

Sure, call all educators "losers". You just show what an uneducated prick you are. But of course the @GOP would want their platform to ridicule education. It is much easier to control those that are dumb. Case in point, the dumb inbred idiots cheering his disrespect of teachers. https://t.co/UWz4rqyVTK

Honestly, the millions of American public school “loser teachers” contribute more to society in one school day than this pathetic sleazeball has in his entire life. https://t.co/aNEoK3W9H1
