Jets get two big goals from Lemieux, celebrate New Year with win over Oilers
VANCOUVER — Humbled and hungry.
That’s how Canada enters the quarterfinals of the World Junior Hockey Championship following a 2-1 loss to Russia on New Year’s Eve.
And, so, the path to gold won’t be easy. Then again, it never is.
“Obviously, every team faces adversity in these tournaments,” said Owen Tippett, who assisted on Canada’s only goal. “We’re happy it came at this time rather than in the elimination round. We just want to recharge and get back at it.”
Canada, which won last year and reached the final two years earlier, last went undefeated in 2015. So a loss in the round robin isn’t the end of the road. If handled properly, it can be a teaching point.
The lesson in Monday’s loss to the Russia is that Canada was not as good as the first three games made it seem.
Sure, the Canadians had run the table against Denmark, Switzerland and the Czech Republic, outscoring their opponents 22-to-3. But it was deceiving.
Russia was Canada’s first challenge — the first opponent that not only matched the Canadians’ immense wealth of speed and skill, but also had the size and the temperament to push back physically.
For Canada, which will face either the United States or Finland in Wednesday’s quarterfinal at 3:30 PT (6:30 ET), it was a taste of things to come.
“Last year we lost a game and it helped our team,” said Team Canada captain Maxime Comtois. “The same thing is going to happen this year. We’re going to re-focus, we’re going to do our homework, and be ready for the next game.”
As head coach Tim Hunter keeps reminding everyone, the games are increasingly becoming more difficult as this tournament goes on. Still, Monday night’s game was a huge jump in difficulty, the equivalent of jumping from a bunny hill to a double black diamond.
Russia also entered the New Year’s Eve game undefeated. But unlike Canada, the Russians faced adversity to get here. They won a 2-1 nail-biter against the Czech Republic earlier in the round robin and had to come from behind in a 7-4 win against Slovakia on Sunday.
The win against Canada makes them the team to beat now.
“We’re confident for the next round,” said Grigori Denisenko, who scored Russia’s first goal. “It was a good win against Canada, psychologically.”
Battled-tested and perhaps a little bitter after losing in last year’s quarter-final — ending a seven-year run of winning a medal — the Russians were a handful for a Canadian team that seemed ill-prepared to play a game of consequence.
“It was important to finish the year with beauty and start the next one on a good note,” said forward Vitali Kravstov, who set up Russia’s first goal. “We played for our country — not a New Year’s Eve game.”
Indeed, there was more than just bragging rights on the line on this night. Both Canada and Russia had been perfect through the first three games of the tournament, setting up a round robin final that had serious implications.
Win and you get the Slovaks (1-3) in the quarterfinal. Lose and the road to the final becomes littered with land mines. Not that anyone is shying away from the upcoming challenge.
“To be the best, you have to beat the best,” said Comtois. “It’s only one loss. We still have a chance to battle for gold. We have to stay positive.”
From an entertainment standpoint, this was when the tournament really began.
This was a rough game, with scrums erupting after nearly whistle and both teams finishing checks and sending a steady stream of players to the penalty box.
Cody Glass gave Canada a 1-0 lead at 2:20 in the first period on a terrific pass from Owen Tippett. But about three minutes later, Russia tied the game on a power play goal from Florida Panthers first-rounder Denisenko.
From there, the offence stalled as Russian goalie Pyotr Kochetkov put on a show.
While Canada’s Michael DiPietro stopped all four shots he faced in the second, Kochetkov made 13 saves to keep Russia in the game.
“He made some huge saves,” said Comtois. “Even for us, Mikey was solid.”
With Kochetkov holding down the fort — he stopped all eight shots he faced in the third — Russia took a 2-1 lead at the 11-minute mark in the final period on a great individual effort from Pavel Shen. Driving the puck wide, the seventh-round pick of the Boston Bruins used his speed to blow past defenceman Markus Phillips before cutting through the crease and tucking the puck in the far corner.
“I knew that I was in trouble,” said Phillips. “When he passed me, I just wanted to get back in front of the net as fast as I could.”
Canada, which had a power play to start the period, had ample opportunities to get another goal. But Kochetkov, who was starting in only his second game of the tournament, proved to be too much.
Still, with 31 shots in the one-goal loss, Canada was hanging onto the positives of what was still a very successful start to the tournmanet.
“We know we’re skilled and can score at any time,” said Glass. “Obviously, we came up short tonight.”
TOP LINE BUZZING
Despite the loss, Canada scored a whopping 23 goals in the round robin portion of the tournament. But it’s safe to say that they relied on their top line of Cody Glass (two goals), Maxime Comtois (four goals) and Owen Tippett (two goals) more than any other.
The trio finished combined for nine goals and 16 points in four games, including a four-goal effort from Comtois against Denmark.
Glass, who has six points, scored the opening goal in the game against Russia when he took a pass in front from Tippett and beat goalie Pyotr Kochetkov.
