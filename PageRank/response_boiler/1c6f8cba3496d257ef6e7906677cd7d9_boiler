President Trump might have paid as many as eight women to have abortions and keep quiet, according to the Spectator.
According to the Spectator , President Donald Trump might have paid as many as eight women to have abortions and stay quiet about sexual affairs — which would be felony offenses, if they occurred during his presidential campaign.
There are rumors, too, of Trump mistresses paid to have abortions and kept quiet with non-disclosure agreements. One source tells Cockburn that there are eight such women. This is more than merely sad and sordid: if any of these payments were made while Trump was running for President, there would be new campaign finance violations, all felony offenses. [Michael] Cohen was said to have handled all this. Cohen was also a vice-president of the Trump Organization and knows about how the secretive family business was conducted. This matters because state prosecutors in New York are now said to be looking again at how condos in Trump buildings were sold – not by Trump, but by his older children, Don Junior, Eric and Ivanka.
