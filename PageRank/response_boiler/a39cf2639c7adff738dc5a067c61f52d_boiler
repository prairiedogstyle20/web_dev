Credit counseling starts with the parent and may include intermediaries later in life empowered by the individual debtor to act on their behalf to negotiate with creditors and resolve debt that is beyond a debtorâ€™s ability to pay. Credit counseling is a generic name and is not a brand name owned or controlled by any agency or company. Consumer credit counseling services are provided by attorneys, accountants, finance and tax professionals, for-profit, and non-profit credit counseling companies. Regulations on credit counseling and credit counseling agencies varies by country and sometimes within regions of the countries themselves. In the United States, individuals filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy are required to receive counseling from a designated credit counseling agency.
