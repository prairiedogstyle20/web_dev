Bishop Lynch among favorites, hosts TAPPS state meet Saturday
Feb 13, 2019
The best wrestlers in TAPPS will converge on Bishop Lynch High School this weekend, as host of the 2019 TAPPS State Wrestling Championships on Saturday.
The Friars will be among a handful of teams – along with Liberty Christian, St. Thomas, and McKinney Christian – that have legitimate shots at winning the team title this year. Bishop Lynch has finished second in the past two state meets, coming up just 2.5 points shy of a title in 2017.
Last year, 10 of the 14 Friars advanced to the finals with two – Warren Walls and Max Mills – winning state titles in their respective weight classes. Three more finished second and the Friars had four bronze medal winners.
Walls will headline the Friar squad as he seeks a third consecutive state title and Luke Mazur will be looking for his second after capturing gold at the 2017 state meet.
According to coach Tom Trautman, other strong competitors from Bishop Lynch include Paul Davis (nationally-ranked), Ben Weber (a favorite in his weight class), Elijah Sisk (returning medalist) and Raul Villa (returning medalist). Trautman says James Hickerson is also capable of winning a state title.
The wrestling begins on Saturday in the Competition Gym at 9:00 am.
