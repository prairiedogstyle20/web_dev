Two of President Donald Trump’s most prominent hotel guests this week have major business before the government that could net them considerable sums of money.
Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold observes that T-Mobile CEO John Legere and Murray Energy Corporation CEO Bob Murray have been seeking government approval for key deals at their respective businesses — and they’ve both been frequent guests at Trump’s Washington, D.C. hotel.

However, as Fahrenthold writes, Murray was both a major donor to Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and is also a regular at the president’s flagship hotel in the nation’s capital.
