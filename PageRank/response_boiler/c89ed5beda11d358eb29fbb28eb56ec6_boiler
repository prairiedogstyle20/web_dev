Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) came under fire Wednesday from an abortion rights group for her support of President Donald Trump’s judicial nominee Michael Liburdi.
In remarks to the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday, Sinema praised Liburdi’s credentials, describing the nominee as a “well-respected attorney” and noting his role as general counsel for Republican Arizona Governor Doug Ducey. Sinema added that while she did not share “all of the same political beliefs” as Liburdi, he was still “professionally qualified" for the role.

Trump nominated Liburdi to become a judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona in January.
But Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, blasted Sinema for her support of Liburdi, calling it “beyond troubling.” The group highlighted Liburdi’s role as chairman of the Arizona Right to Life PAC as well as his work for Ducey, who signed a law last year that requires doctors ask women seeking an abortion the reason for their decision.
“Democratic Senators should be doing everything in their power to fight these efforts to stack courts against women and families,” Hogue said in a statement. “You can’t claim you are an advocate of women and our reproductive freedom just because you vote correctly on some legislation if, at the same time, you help elevate right-wing judges who will inflict long-term damage to our cause.”
