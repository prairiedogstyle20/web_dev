Hockey: Suffern and Greeley go into Section 1 tournament as top seeds

Suffern knows the routine.
Nobody in this locker room has won a Section 1 title. The last championship was celebrated in 2013, but the Mounties keep putting themselves in play.
The postseason run is up to nine straight championship appearances.
"It definitely helps to have that experience," Suffern coach Rob Schelling noted. "They've been there before. We put a tough schedule together so everyone is prepared. They're used to the big crowds that we usually get for these games.
"Now it's game time."
The Mounties' only loss came Dec. 3 against Bethlehem. 
"We've been playing well as a team, we're all working hard in practice and we're kind of on a tear," senior defenseman Josh Abbott said. "We haven't lost in like two months. The offense is finally clicking. The defense has been stellar. I think it could be a good playoff run for us."
And they have been focused on the playoffs for weeks.
"We all want it," Abbott added. "The playoffs are one game, not a series. We have to come in thinking any team can beat us. We have to play a full 51 minutes. We can't take a period off."
Unlike past years, Suffern is going into the postseason as the favorite.
"I really don't think there is any more pressure because we haven't won it," Schelling explained. "There is pressure when you put on the Suffern sweater and every season the goal is to win a sectional championship. It's not easy. Our section has gotten so much better. Our goal is to win the league and get the No. 1 seed. That's where we are and now it's playoff time."
