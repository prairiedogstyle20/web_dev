Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called the government a "disastrous dictatorship" while National Security Advisor John Bolton said Mr Maduro was holding an "illegitimate claim to power".
When asked, in response to his Ku Klux Klan comment, if he believed Mr Trump was a "white supremacist", Mr Maduro said: "He is, publicly and openly... They hate us, they belittle us, because they only believe in their own interests, and in the interests of the United States."

The president has rejected allowing foreign humanitarian aid into the country, a move that is being organised by the opposition. He said Venezuela had "the capacity to satisfy all the needs of its people" and did not have to "beg from anyone".

But for years Venezuelans have faced severe shortages of basic items such as medicine and food. Last year, the inflation rate saw prices doubling every 19 days on average.
Three million people, or 10% of the population, have left the country since the economy started to worsen in 2014, according to the UN. And Mr Guaidó says more than 300,000 Venezuelans are at "risk of dying".
The men willing to die for Maduro's cause
Mr Maduro, who has blamed US sanctions for Venezuela's economic woes, said the US intended to "create a humanitarian crisis in order to justify a military intervention".
"This is part of that charade. That's why, with all dignity, we tell them we don't want their crumbs, their toxic food, their left-overs."

Head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, Mr Guaidó declared himself president on 23 January, saying the constitution allowed him to assume power temporarily when the president was deemed illegitimate.

Mr Maduro - who still has the support of Turkey, Russia and China and, crucially, of the Venezuelan army - said he did not see the need for early presidential elections.
"What's the logic, reasoning, to repeat an election?" he asked.
He also said only "about 10" governments supported Mr Guaidó - in fact, more than 30 have announced their support for the opposition leader - and that they were trying to "impose a government that nobody has elected".
"The extremists of the White House have taken it upon themselves to carry out a coup in Venezuela."
