The dogphobia of Donald Trump
The President is having a ruff time
Whatsapp
Donald Trump doesn’t want a dog, for fear of looking phony , he says. But Cockburn can’t help wondering if there isn’t a deeper neurosis here. The president, it seems, is a dogphobe. He once was reported to have said ‘I never understood why people like dogs. Dogs are disgusting’ — though Snopes declared that fake news .
Trump does however seem to have a strange canine preoccupation. He has used the word ‘dog’ over  40 times on Twitter. He employs the formulation ‘like a dog’ with particular regularity — often, misusing the dog simile.
. @georgewillf is perhaps the most boring political pundit on television. Got thrown off ABC like a dog. At Mar-a-Lago he was a total bust!

. @DavidGregory got thrown off of TV by NBC, fired like a dog! Now he is on @CNN being nasty to me. Not nice!

Are dogs thrown off TV?
. @GlennBeck got fired like a dog by #Fox . The Blaze is failing and he wanted to have me on his show. I said no – because he is irrelevant.

Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication. He used him as a scape goat-fired like a dog! Ted panicked.

Wow, great news! I hear @EWErickson of Red State was fired like a dog. If you read his tweets, you'll understand why. Just doesn't have IT!

I hear that sleepy eyes @chucktodd will be fired like a dog from ratings starved Meet The Press? I can't imagine what is taking so long!

Do dogs get fired?
Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart. She cheated on him like a dog & will do it again–just watch. He can do much better!

Are dogs unfaithful? Cockburn thought famously that wasn’t the case…
Obama called Reverend Wright his friend, counselor & great leader–then dumped him like a dog!

Do dogs get dumped?
And, Cockburn’s favorite,
. @BrentBozell , one of the National Review lightweights, came to my office begging for money like a dog. Why doesn't he say that?

He’s also displayed a predilection for comparing women to dogs (though incidentally has only tweeted the word ‘bitch’ twice, when quoting someone else):
When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn’t work out. Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!

" @laurasgoldman : . @realDonaldTrump why is it necessary to comment on . @ariannahuff looks? Because she is a dog who wrongfully comments on me

And he loves to say how unsuccessful politicians ‘couldn’t get elected dog catcher’.
. @GovernorPataki couldn’t be elected dog catcher if he ran again—so he didn’t!

Bob Corker, who helped President O give us the bad Iran Deal & couldn't get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts….

. @GovernorSununu who couldn't get elected dog catcher in NH forgot to mention my phenomenal biz success rate: 99.2% https://t.co/WsA3Jnjhwa

There is a clear pattern here. Cockburn wonders: was the President bitten by a dog as a child? Or did — horror of horrors — a dog ask young Donald for money?
