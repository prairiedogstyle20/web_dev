Â 
President Donald Trump is set to give remarks Wednesday afternoon, amidst reports he intends to sign a bipartisan deal to avert a government shutdown and fund a small part of his border wall.
Trump is set to speak at the Major County Sheriffs & Cities Chiefs Association Joint Conference in Washington D.C., and is expected to remark on the deal, which he has expressed skepticism about but is reportedly prepared to sign.
The deal includes $1.375 billion for a border barrier, a sum that falls short of the $5.7 billion Trump has demanded.
The president was set to speak at 3 p.m. EST, but is running a few minutes late. Watch above, via the White House.
