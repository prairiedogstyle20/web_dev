Democrats claim Robert Mueller is above reproach in his reputation as a stand-up bureaucrat.
This means that Mueller is a straight-up gangster at the disposal of Democrats. And only a moronic Leftist would believe otherwise. 
In this article we document two instances where Mueller played fast and loose with the law. And we begin with a report from John Solomon of The Hill.
Trisha Anderson , who recently stepped down as the FBI’s principal deputy general counsel, told House investigators late last year in an interview that early in Mueller’s FBI tenure, nearly two decades ago, the FISC summoned the new director to appear before the judges to address concerns about extensive cheating on FISA warrants.
“It preceded my time with the FBI but as I understood it, there was a pattern of some incidents of omission that were of concern to the FISA court that resulted in former Director Mueller actually appearing before the FISA court,” Anderson told Congress.
Other sources who worked for Mueller at the time told me the court’s concerns arose in 2002 and 2003 — shortly after America was stunned by the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks — when the FISC learned the FBI had omitted material facts from FISA warrant applications in  more than 75 terrorism cases  that dated back to the late 1990s.
Most of the omissions occurred in FBI work that pre-dated Mueller’s arrival, the sources said. But the court wanted assurances the new sheriff in town was going to stop such widespread abuses.
Mueller told the court the FBI had created a new system called the Woods Procedures — named for the FBI lawyer who drafted them — to ensure FISA warrant applications were accurate and did not omit material information, according to Anderson’s congressional interview.
“My understanding is he committed to the court to address the problem and then that the series of reforms that we implemented, including the use of the Woods form, were the direct result of his engagement before the FISA court,” Anderson told Congress.
Does anybody believe the Comey-led FBI followed the Woods Procedures?
Their use of a fake dossier financed by the Clinton campaign should have landed half the agency behind bars. Until you remember who “the fixer” is.

The Hill article continues,
A declassified Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court order from 2002 reveals just how serious the abuses were. Solomon reports that in one case, the FBI failed to tell the FISA court that the individual they were seeking a warrant on was one of their own informants!
Anderson’s testimony revealed the FBI was abusing the FISA court many years ago but we now know the bureau continued the FISA abuse well into 2016 and 2017.
But Mueller’s treachery against innocent Republicans didn’t end in 2002.
From Must Read Alaska , we learn of how corrupt Robert Mueller and the FBI can be. In this case, they led a witch hunt against Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska.
The following is an excerpt from “Robert Mueller: Unmasked,” a report published by Congressman Louie Gohmert of Texas, in which he makes several claims about a number of witch hunts conducted by the former FBI director.
As reported by NPR , after the conviction and all truth came rolling out of the framing and conviction of Senator Stevens, the new Attorney General Eric Holder, had no choice. He “abandoned the Stevens case in April 2009 after uncovering new and ‘disturbing’ details about the prosecution…”
Unfortunately for Ted Stevens, his conviction came only eight days before his election, which tipped the scales on a close election.
Does this sound familiar yet?
The allegation was that Senator Stevens had not paid full price for improvements to his Alaska cabin. As Roll Call reported, he had actually overpaid for the improvements by over twenty percent. Roll Call went on to state:
“But relying on false records and fueled by testimony from a richly rewarded ‘cooperating’ witness… government prosecutors convinced jurors to find him guilty just eight days before the general election which  he lost by less than 2 percent of the vote .”
After a report substantiated massive improprieties by the FBI and DOJ in the investigation and prosecution of Senator Stevens, the result was ultimately a complete dismissal of the conviction.
So Mueller and team interfered with an election, costing Ted Stevens his job. But they did more than that, as you will see in just a bit.
Initially, it appeared Mueller had no information about the abuses by the FBI. But that turned out to not be true as well.
Must read Alaska continues,
At the time there was no direct evidence that Director Mueller was aware of the tactics of concealing exculpatory evidence that would have exonerated Stevens, and the creation of evidence that convicted him in 2008. Nearly four years later, in 2012, the Alaska Dispatch News concluded:
“Bottom line: Kepner (the lead FBI investigator accused of wrongdoing by Agent Joy) is still working for the FBI and is still investigating cases, including criminal probes. Joy, the whistleblower (who was the FBI agent who disclosed the FBI’s vast wrongdoing, especially of Kepner), has left the agency.” 
Director Mueller either did control or could have controlled what happened to the lead FBI agent that destroyed a well-respected U.S. Senator. That U.S. Senator was not only completely innocent of the manufactured case against him, he was an honest and honorable man. Under Director Mueller’s overriding supervision, the wrongdoer who helped manufacture the case stayed on and the whistleblower was punished. Obviously, the FBI Director wanted his FBI agents to understand that honesty would be punished if it revealed wrongdoing within Mueller’s organization.
Further, not only was evidentiary proof of Senator Stevens’ innocence concealed from the Senator’s defense attorneys by the FBI, there was also a witness that provided compelling testimony that Stevens’ had done everything appropriately. That witness, however, was who agents sent back to Alaska by FBI Agents, unbeknownst to the Senator’s defense attorneys.
This key exonerating testimony was placed out of reach for Senator Stevens’ defense. Someone should have gone to jail for this illegality within the nation’s top law enforcement agency. Instead, Senator Stevens lost his seat, and surprise, surprise, Mueller’s FBI helped another elected Republican bite the dust. Unfortunately, I am not speaking figuratively.
As Louie Gomert points out things for Stevens and America don’t end well.
In August of 2010, former Senator Stevens boarded his doomed plane. But for the heinous, twisted and corrupt investigation by the FBI, and inappropriate prosecution by the DOJ, he would have still been a sitting U.S. Senator. Don’t forget, one vote in the Senate was critical to ObamaCare becoming law also. If Senator Stevens was still there, it would not have become law.
In the following month after Senator Stevens’ untimely death, in September of 2010, a young DOJ lawyer, Nicholas Marsh who had been involved in the Stevens case, committed suicide at his home as the investigation into the fraudulently created case continued. The report expressed, “no conclusion as to his (Marsh’s) conduct,” given his untimely death. Robert Luskin, an attorney for Marsh, said, “he tried to do the right thing.” 
If you wonder what happened to the valuable FBI agent who was an upstandingwhistleblower with a conscience, you should know that in Mueller’s FBI, Special Agent Joy was terribly mistreated. Orders came down from on high that he was not to participate in any criminal investigation again, which is the FBI management’s way of forcing an agent out of the FBI. On the other hand, the FBI agent who was said to have manufactured evidence against Senator Stevens while hiding evidence of his innocence was treated wonderfully and continued to work important criminal cases for Director Mueller.
Mueller will be exposed for what he is.
He’s delayed publishing his report! And it’s because he wasted millions of dollars and lots of time on a witch hunt that yielded exactly nothing.
Soon the dominoes begin falling, and with them Democrats’ credibility.
