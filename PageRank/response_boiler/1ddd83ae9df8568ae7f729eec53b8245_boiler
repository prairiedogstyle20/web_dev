Trump lied about how many people attended his rally. The fire department obliterated the fabrication immediately.
The fire department in El Paso, Texas, called out Trump for lying and inflating the number of people who attended his rally there Monday night.
During his rally, Trump attacked former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX), who also  held a rally protesting Trump’s racist border wall and his policy of stealing migrant children from their families.
“A young man who’s got very little going for himself, except he’s got a great first name, he is, he has challenged us. So we have, let’s say, 35,000 people tonight — and he has 200 people, 300 people, not too good,” Trump whined.
That was a lie.
“El Paso Fire Department just told us that Trump’s statement about them allowing 10,000 people inside is incorrect,” wrote Zahira Torres of the El Paso Times. “Spokesman says coliseum holds 6,500 and that is how many were allowed in building.”
At O’Rourke’s rally, on the other hand, police estimated  a crowd of “10,000 to 15,000” people.
In other words, the crowd Trump mocked was bigger than his own rally.
Trump is a serial liar, who often lies about easily disprovable things like crowd size. He didn’t have to lie about how many people came to his rally, or to O’Rourke’s event. But Trump regularly exaggerates his crowd sizes, and he did so again Monday night.
This time, the lie was quickly debunked by a local fire department.
