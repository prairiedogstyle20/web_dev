WARREN — The 3-point shot has changed the game of basketball over the years. Coaches at all levels devise ways to get players an open look from long distance. Mid-range shots aren’t as useful as they once were.
“Since I’ve been here, I’ve preached lay-ups and 3s,” John F. Kennedy coach Mark Komlanc said. “That’s it. I don’t want any other shot. I don’t want any mid-range. We’re going to attack the hoop, and get lay-ups if we can get them. Otherwise, we’re going to get the ball moving, and kick it out.”
The strategy kept JFK in their game Tuesday night for three quarters, before the Eagles ran out of gas in a 60-40 loss to Valley Christian. Other than one free throw, the Eagles only made shots from behind the arc in the first half.
Kennedy made eight 3’s by halftime, including three apiece from Gianni Eaton and Josiah Hayes. Valley Christian (13-4) jumped out to a 17-9 lead after one quarter. The Eagles’ hot shooting from deep got them back in it in the second. Valley Christian led 26-25 at the break.
Eaton drilled another trey to start the second half. JFK’s only three 2-point baskets, came during a quick stretch beginning with 5 minutes left in the third. A good take by Hayes, followed by a bucket from Cameron Hollobaugh, and a lay-up from Marcus Aulizia, put Kennedy on top 34-32. Hayes made another from downtown, but Valley Christian took a 38-37 lead into the fourth quarter.
It all fell apart for JFK in the final quarter. The beginning of the end was when Lohron Brown tossed a perfect alley-oop pass to senior Milan Square. Square slammed it home, and finished with a game-high 27 points.
“JFK came out and hit some shots,” Square said. “That’s a very good team over there. They have some great shooters. We waited for our opportunity to play Valley Christian basketball. In the fourth quarter, we did that.”
Hayes nailed his fifth 3 of the game early in the fourth. He finished with a team-high 17 points for JFK. That basket made it 44-40 Valley Christian. The visitors went on to score the final 16 points of the game.
A stifling full-court press made getting the ball up court difficult for JFK. Senior Melvin Neail put an exclamation point on the victory, with an emphatic dunk to end it.
JFK is readying themselves for their upcoming tournament game against Maplewood.
“We played really well, against a very athletic team, for three quarters,” Komlanc said. “Everything is about moving forward, and getting better. I’ll take the loss. The loss is my fault. Because the last two days, I ran the crap out of them.
“We’re not thinking about the here and now. We’re thinking about the future. We’re thinking about the tournament in two weeks. We have big picture in mind. Tonight, they started to see how good they could be. It hurt for them to lose. That’s something that tells me we’re going in the right direction.”
