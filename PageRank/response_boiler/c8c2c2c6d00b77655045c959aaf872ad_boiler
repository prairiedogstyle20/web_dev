YPSILANTI, MI - A federal judge has ordered Eastern Michigan University to reinstate its women’s tennis and softball programs by the fall of 2019.
U.S. District Judge Caram Steeh issued the ruling Tuesday, Feb. 12, nearly 11 months after the sports were eliminated by the university.
A federal lawsuit was filed in June 2018 by former women’s tennis team member Marie Mayerova and softball player Ariana Chretien, who claimed EMU was not providing effective accommodation to female student-athletes.
While EMU was able to reinstate its women’s tennis program, the two sides reached an impasse over whether bringing back softball is logistically possible . Recently, EMU suggested adding women’s lacrosse instead of bringing back softball, because it would cost less and bring in more athletes paying their way to attend EMU.
Steeh’s ruling, however, said EMU must hire a softball coach by April 1, in order to give that person appropriate time to scout and recruit players.
EMU must allocate the necessary budget to hire the same number of staff and coaches it had prior to its decision to eliminate the sport last March.
“We are extremely happy with the Court’s order,” said Jill Zwagerman, an attorney for the student-athletes. "Our clients are truly excited to get back to practicing and playing the sports they love. We are hopeful with this ruling that EMU can finally move forward with providing equal opportunities to all of its student athletes.
“The Court has ordered EMU now twice to reinstate women’s tennis and softball. It’s time for EMU to do its part in complying with Title IX.”
Mediation between former student-athletes and the EMU Athletic Department are at an impasse.
In September, Steeh ruled there was a “clear showing that (EMU is) in violation of Title IX,” when it eliminated softball and women’s tennis and that it must work out a plan to bring the teams back.
Steeh went a step further in his latest judgment, saying that reinstating the two sports might not be enough for the university to be in compliance with Title IX.
“Having determined that the elimination of the tennis and softball teams violated Title IX, and that Plaintiffs have demonstrated irreparable harm, the court emphasizes that the appropriate remedy is the reinstatement of those teams,” Steeh said. “Indeed, given the current disparity between participation opportunities for men and women at EMU, the reinstatement of the tennis and softball teams represents only one step in the direction of the university’s compliance with Title IX.”
In bringing back softball, EMU must also allocate the same number of scholarships to the softball and women’s tennis team it had prior to elimination, Steeh ordered.
The university also must make any necessary repairs to the softball field, organize competitive tournament and conference schedules, equipment and uniform orders, and any other scheduling, hiring, or purchasing, to ensure the team is ready to compete for the 2019-2020 season.
In a letter to Steeh, EMU Athletic Director Scott Wetherbee said reinstating softball would cost approximately $870,000 per year in team operating expenses, combined with awarding 12 athletic scholarships on a team consisting of 17 to 20 members.
EMU Spokesman Geoff Larcom said the university will be studying the ruling and determining its next steps in the days ahead.
“As we have stated previously, we are determined to meet our Title IX obligations completely and efficiently,” he said.
“It is important to note that the decision to reduce the number of sports offered at Eastern Michigan was designed to put us in alignment with our Mid-American Conference (MAC) counterparts, including Central Michigan and Western Michigan,” Larcom offered, as he has throughout the litigation process. "At the time of the reduction, Eastern offered 21 sports, the most in the MAC. This was not sustainable in the long term, and was similar to the reduction of four sports taken at the University of Buffalo (another MAC school) in 2017.
“Our actions reflect our determined efforts to be fiscally responsible and to realign resources so that we can continue to invest in the academic success, and the support of, our student,” he added.
Steeh noted that while EMU had started the process of bringing back women’s tennis, the short timeline has hampered full reinstatement of the team for this season.
Staffing must be brought back to the same levels the team had prior to eliminating the sport, Steeh said, with full reinstatement scheduled for fall 2019.
EMU eliminated the two women’s sports in March, along with the men’s wrestling and swimming and diving programs, in an effort to reduce its athletic budget by $2.4 million. Overall, the cuts impacted 58 male and 25 female student-athletes participating in the four canceled sports.
