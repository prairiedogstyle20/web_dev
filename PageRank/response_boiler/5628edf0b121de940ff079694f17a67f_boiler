The firm, Morning Consult, releases monthly approval ratings for Trump from each state .
In January 2017, the month Trump was sworn into office, he was  broadly popular across a wide geographic area. Trump had a  negative net approval rating - the share of the population  approving of his performance minus the percentage disapproving -  in only six states and Washington, DC.
Unsurprisingly, some of Trump's highest approval ratings came  from stalwart Republican states in the interior of the country  and the Southeast, while his lowest net approval came from  liberal bastions on the West Coast and in the Northeast, along  with the crucial upper Midwestern swing states.

By January 2019, two years after taking office and during a month  marked by a dramatic 35-day-long partial federal government shutdown , Trump's net approval  rating had declined in every state and the District of Columbia.  Drops in net approval ranged from 10 percentage points in Wyoming  to a massive 35-point swing against the president in New Mexico.
Here's where Trump stood in every state in January, according to  Morning Consult:
